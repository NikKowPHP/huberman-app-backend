**Huberman App: Complex Workflow & Algorithm Design**

**1. Introduction**

This document details the specific logic and design patterns for key complex workflows within the Huberman App backend. It elaborates on the processes outlined in `detailed_plan.md` and builds upon the modular structure defined in `component_breakdown.md` and `component_interfaces_interactions.md`. The goal is to provide clear implementation guidance for developers working on these critical features.

**2. Subscription Lifecycle Management**

*   **Goal:** To accurately track the state of a user's subscription across different providers (Stripe, Apple IAP, Google Play Billing) based on webhook events and scheduled checks.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `SubscriptionBilling` Module: `SubscriptionService`, `WebhookController`, `Subscription` Model.
    *   `plans` table, `subscriptions` table (`status`, `ends_at`, `trial_ends_at` columns are crucial).
    *   Payment Providers: Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google sending webhooks/notifications.
*   **Core Logic (State Machine):** The `subscriptions.status` field represents the current state. Transitions are triggered primarily by provider webhooks handled by the `WebhookController` which delegates processing to the `SubscriptionService`.

    *   **States:**
        *   `incomplete`: Initial state after checkout initiation but before successful payment (relevant for Stripe Checkout/Paddle).
        *   `trialing`: User is in a free trial period (requires `trial_ends_at` to be set).
        *   `active`: User has a paid, currently valid subscription. `ends_at` indicates the end of the current paid period.
        *   `past_due`: Payment failed, provider is retrying (Stripe/Paddle specific). Grace period might apply.
        *   `canceled`: User explicitly canceled *or* payment failed definitively. Subscription may remain active until `ends_at`. Feature access depends on whether `ends_at` is in the future.
        *   `expired`: The subscription period (`ends_at`) has passed, and it was not renewed (either due to cancellation or final payment failure). No access.

    *   **State Transitions (Conceptual - Provider events may vary):**
        *   **(Checkout) -> `incomplete`**: User initiates checkout (Stripe/Paddle).
        *   `incomplete` -> `active`/`trialing`: `checkout.session.completed` (Stripe), `subscription_created` (Paddle) webhook received with successful payment or trial setup. Update `status`, `ends_at`, `trial_ends_at`.
        *   `trialing` -> `active`: `invoice.payment_succeeded` (Stripe) or `subscription_payment_succeeded` (Paddle) after trial ends. Update `status`, `ends_at`. *OR* could happen via scheduled job checking `trial_ends_at`.
        *   `trialing` -> `expired`: Trial ends, no payment method, or user canceled during trial. `customer.subscription.updated` (Stripe), `subscription_canceled` (Paddle), `DID_FAIL_TO_RENEW` (Apple), `SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRED` (Google). Update `status`.
        *   `active` -> `active`: Renewal successful. `invoice.payment_succeeded` (Stripe), `subscription_payment_succeeded` (Paddle), `DID_RENEW` (Apple), `SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWED` (Google). Update `ends_at` for the next period.
        *   `active` -> `past_due`: Renewal payment fails. `invoice.payment_failed` (Stripe - requires action), `subscription_payment_failed` (Paddle). Update `status`.
        *   `active` -> `canceled`: User cancels via provider portal/app. `customer.subscription.updated` (Stripe - `cancel_at_period_end=true`), `subscription_canceled` (Paddle), `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS` (Apple - off), `SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELED` (Google). Update `status`. Subscription *might* remain usable until `ends_at`.
        *   `past_due` -> `active`: Successful payment after retry. `invoice.payment_succeeded` (Stripe), `subscription_payment_succeeded` (Paddle). Update `status`, `ends_at`.
        *   `past_due` -> `canceled`: Final retry fails. `customer.subscription.updated` (Stripe - status `canceled`), `subscription_payment_failed` (Paddle - after retries). Update `status`. Set `ends_at` to now/past if not already.
        *   `canceled` -> `expired`: `ends_at` date is reached for a canceled subscription. Can be handled by a scheduled job checking `subscriptions` where `status = canceled` and `ends_at <= NOW()`. Update `status`.

    *   **Webhook Handling:** `WebhookController` receives POST request, verifies signature (critical!), determines provider and event type, and calls `SubscriptionService::handleWebhook()`. Service parses payload, finds relevant `User`/`Subscription`, updates DB state, and fires internal Laravel events (e.g., `SubscriptionRenewed`, `SubscriptionCanceled`) for other modules to react to.
    *   **Provider Differences:** Apple/Google require server-side receipt validation and parsing specific notification types (App Store Server Notifications V2 / Google Play Developer API RTDN). Logic needs to map their events to the internal state machine.

**3. Feature Gating Logic**

*   **Goal:** To restrict access to premium API routes and potentially limit usage of certain features (e.g., number of notes) based on the user's active subscription status.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   Laravel Middleware (e.g., `CheckPremiumAccess`).
    *   Laravel Policies (e.g., `NotePolicy`).
    *   `SubscriptionBilling` Module: `SubscriptionServiceInterface::userHasActivePremiumSubscription()`.
    *   `subscriptions` table.
    *   Redis Cache.
*   **Core Logic (Middleware Example - `CheckPremiumAccess`):**
    ```php
    // App/Http/Middleware/CheckPremiumAccess.php (Conceptual)
    namespace App\Http\Middleware;

    use Closure;
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
    use App\Modules\SubscriptionBilling\Contracts\SubscriptionServiceInterface; // Use Interface

    class CheckPremiumAccess
    {
        protected $subscriptionService;

        public function __construct(SubscriptionServiceInterface $subscriptionService) {
            $this->subscriptionService = $subscriptionService;
        }

        public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
        {
            $user = Auth::user();

            if (!$user) {
                return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthenticated.'], 401); // Should be handled by 'auth:sanctum' earlier
            }

            // 1. Check Cache First
            $cacheKey = "user:{$user->id}:is_premium";
            $isPremium = Cache::get($cacheKey);

            if ($isPremium === null) {
                // 2. Cache Miss: Ask the Subscription Service
                $isPremium = $this->subscriptionService->userHasActivePremiumSubscription($user);
                // 3. Update Cache (e.g., for 15 minutes)
                Cache::put($cacheKey, $isPremium, now()->addMinutes(15));
            }

            if (!$isPremium) {
                // 4. Deny Access if not Premium
                return response()->json(['message' => 'Premium subscription required.'], 403);
            }

            // 5. Allow Access
            return $next($request);
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Core Logic (`SubscriptionServiceInterface::userHasActivePremiumSubscription`):**
    *   Takes a `User` object as input.
    *   Queries the `subscriptions` table:
        *   `WHERE user_id = ?`
        *   `WHERE status IN ['active', 'trialing']` (Or just `active` if trials don't grant full access).
        *   *(Optional but recommended)* `WHERE (ends_at IS NULL OR ends_at > NOW())` - Handles cases where status might be `canceled` but still within the paid period.
        *   Needs join/check against `plans` table to ensure the active subscription is for a *premium* plan type.
    *   Returns `true` if such a subscription exists, `false` otherwise.
*   **Policy Integration:** Policies (e.g., `NotePolicy::create(User $user)`) can inject `SubscriptionServiceInterface` and call `userHasActivePremiumSubscription()` or check feature flags (e.g., note limits based on plan) as part of their authorization logic.
*   **Application:** Apply the `CheckPremiumAccess` middleware to API routes/groups in `routes/api.php` that correspond to premium features. Use Policies for model-specific authorization checks within controllers.

**4. Customizable Reminders (Premium)**

*   **Goal:** Allow premium users to set custom reminders for specific protocols, triggering a push notification at the user-defined time/frequency in their local timezone.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `ProtocolEngine` Module: `ReminderController`, `ReminderService`, `UserReminder` Model (stores `user_id`, `protocol_id`, `reminder_time`, `frequency`, `timezone`, `last_sent_at`, `is_active`, `device_token` - *CRITICAL*).
    *   Laravel Task Scheduling (`app/Console/Kernel.php`).
    *   Laravel Queues & Workers.
    *   `SendProtocolReminderNotification` Job & Notification class.
    *   Push Notification Service (e.g., FCM, APNS via Laravel Notifications or specific SDKs).
    *   React Native App (responsible for getting and sending the device token to the backend).
*   **Core Logic:**

    1.  **Device Token Registration:** When the user logs in or enables notifications, the React Native app gets the unique device push token (FCM/APNS) and sends it to the backend API (e.g., `POST /api/user/device-token`). The backend stores this token, likely associated with the `User` model or a dedicated `devices` table. *Storing multiple tokens per user is necessary if they use multiple devices.*
    2.  **Reminder Creation (API):** User interacts with RN UI -> `POST /api/reminders` -> `ReminderController` -> `ReminderService::setReminder()`.
        *   Service validates input (requires premium check).
        *   Saves reminder details to `user_reminders` table, including user's selected time, frequency (daily, weekly, specific days), protocol, and user's current timezone (stored e.g., on `users` table or passed in request). *Crucially, it needs access to the user's valid device token(s) when the notification job runs.*
    3.  **Scheduled Task (`Kernel.php`):** A console command is scheduled to run frequently (e.g., every minute).
        ```php
        // app/Console/Kernel.php
        protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
        {
            $schedule->command('reminders:send-due')->everyMinute();
            // OR use $schedule->job(new ProcessDueReminders)->everyMinute();
        }
        ```
    4.  **Processing Due Reminders (`reminders:send-due` Command / `ProcessDueReminders` Job):**
        *   Get the current time (UTC).
        *   Query the `user_reminders` table for active reminders (`is_active = true`).
        *   **Crucially, for each reminder:**
            *   Convert the *current UTC time* to the *user's stored timezone*.
            *   Check if the user's local time matches the `reminder_time` stored for the reminder.
            *   Check if the frequency matches (e.g., is it the correct day of the week?).
            *   Check `last_sent_at` to avoid double-sending if the job runs slightly late.
        *   For each reminder determined to be *due now*:
            *   Dispatch a `SendProtocolReminderNotification` job to the queue, passing the `user_reminder_id` or necessary details.
            ```php
            // Conceptual Command/Job Logic
            $nowUtc = now();
            $dueReminders = UserReminder::where('is_active', true)->cursor(); // Use cursor for memory efficiency

            foreach ($dueReminders as $reminder) {
                $userTimezone = $reminder->user->timezone ?? 'UTC'; // Get user timezone
                $nowInUserTz = $nowUtc->copy()->setTimezone($userTimezone);
                $reminderTime = Carbon::parse($reminder->reminder_time, $userTimezone); // Time stored without date

                // Compare times (HH:MM) and check frequency/day constraints
                if ($nowInUserTz->format('H:i') == $reminderTime->format('H:i') && /* check frequency match */ && /* check not recently sent */) {
                   SendProtocolReminderNotification::dispatch($reminder);
                   // Optionally update last_sent_at here or in the job
                }
            }
            ```
    5.  **Sending Notification (`SendProtocolReminderNotification` Job):**
        *   Executed by a queue worker.
        *   Retrieves the `UserReminder` and associated `User` and `Protocol`.
        *   Fetches the target user's valid device token(s) (from `users` or `devices` table).
        *   Constructs the notification payload (title, body with protocol name).
        *   Uses Laravel's Notification system (e.g., `Notification::send($user, new ProtocolReminder($protocol))`) or a specific service (FCM/APNS) to send the push notification to the user's device token(s).
        *   Handles potential errors (e.g., invalid token). Updates `last_sent_at` on the `UserReminder`.

**5. Tracking & Visualization Logic (Premium)**

*   **Goal:** Allow premium users to log their adherence to protocols and view progress visualizations like streaks or completion rates.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `ProtocolEngine` Module: `TrackingController`, `TrackingService`.
    *   `user_protocol_tracking` table (`id`, `user_id`, `protocol_id`, `tracked_at` (DATE), `notes`, `metadata`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
*   **Data Storage:** Each time a user marks a protocol as completed for a specific day, a record is created in `user_protocol_tracking`. The `tracked_at` field (DATE type) is key. The unique constraint `(user_id, protocol_id, tracked_at)` prevents duplicates.
*   **Logging Adherence (API):** User taps "Mark Done" -> `POST /api/tracking/log` (with `protocol_id` and optional `date`) -> `TrackingController` -> `TrackingService::logAdherence()`.
    *   Service validates input (requires premium check).
    *   Inserts or updates record in `user_protocol_tracking`. Use `updateOrCreate` based on the unique constraint.
*   **Visualization - Streak Calculation (Example):**
    *   **API:** `GET /api/tracking/summary?protocol_id={id}&metric=streak` -> `TrackingController` -> `TrackingService::calculateStreak()`.
    *   **`TrackingService::calculateStreak(User $user, int $protocolId)` Logic (Conceptual Pseudo-code):**
        ```pseudo
        function calculateStreak(user, protocolId):
          streak = 0
          today = currentDate() // Or maybe the latest tracked date for this user/protocol? Decide requirement.

          // Get relevant tracking dates, ordered descending
          trackedDates = query database:
             SELECT tracked_at FROM user_protocol_tracking
             WHERE user_id = user.id AND protocol_id = protocolId
             ORDER BY tracked_at DESC

          if trackedDates is empty:
             return 0

          // Check if the most recent tracking is today or yesterday (allows continuation)
          latestTrackedDate = trackedDates[0]
          if latestTrackedDate is not today AND latestTrackedDate is not yesterday:
             return 0 // Streak broken if >1 day missed

          // Check consecutive days backward
          expectedDate = today
          if latestTrackedDate is yesterday:
             expectedDate = yesterday // Start checking from yesterday if today wasn't logged

          for date in trackedDates:
             if date == expectedDate:
                streak = streak + 1
                expectedDate = expectedDate.subtract(1 day) // Look for the previous day
             else if date < expectedDate:
                 // Gap detected, streak broken before this date
                 break
             // else if date > expectedDate: This shouldn't happen with ORDER BY DESC

          return streak
        ```
*   **Other Visualizations:**
    *   **Completion % (e.g., Monthly):** Query `user_protocol_tracking` for the user/protocol within the date range. Count distinct `tracked_at` days. Divide by the total number of days in the month.
    *   **Calendar Heatmap:** Query all `tracked_at` dates for the user/protocol within a visible range. Frontend uses this data to color calendar days.

**6. Conclusion**

These detailed workflow descriptions provide a blueprint for implementing the core complex features of the Huberman App. Adhering to these designs, leveraging appropriate Laravel features (Middleware, Policies, Queues, Scheduling, Events), and carefully handling state transitions and edge cases (especially with external providers) will be crucial for building a robust and reliable backend.

--- START FILE: app_documentation/api_design_documentation.md ---
Okay, let's create the plan document (`api_design_documentation.md`) outlining the process and standards for creating the OpenAPI specification, and then provide a conceptual structure for the `openapi.yaml` file itself.

--- START OF FILE api_design_documentation.md ---

**Huberman App: API Design & Documentation Plan (OpenAPI)**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the process and standards for creating and maintaining the RESTful API contract for the Huberman App backend using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger). The resulting `openapi.yaml` file will serve as the single source of truth for API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication, authorization requirements, and error handling. This ensures clear communication and alignment between the backend (Laravel) and frontend (React Native) development teams, facilitating efficient integration and testing.

**2. Tooling and Format**

*   **Specification Version:** OpenAPI 3.x (latest stable version recommended).
*   **Format:** YAML (`openapi.yaml`) is preferred for its readability compared to JSON.
*   **Generation/Maintenance:**
    *   **Initial Creation:** Likely manual or semi-automated based on initial controller/route definitions.
    *   **Ongoing Maintenance:** Consider using code annotations (e.g., `zircote/swagger-php` for Laravel) to generate the spec from PHP attributes/docblocks. This keeps documentation closer to the code but requires disciplined annotation. Alternatively, manual updates are feasible if rigorously maintained alongside code changes. The chosen method must be consistently applied.
    *   **Validation:** Use OpenAPI validation tools (online validators, editor plugins, CLI tools) regularly, potentially integrated into CI/CD pipelines, to ensure the spec is syntactically correct and adheres to the standard.

**3. Core Specification Structure**

The `openapi.yaml` file will utilize the following key sections:

*   `openapi`: Specifies the OpenAPI version.
*   `info`: Contains metadata (title, version, description).
*   `servers`: Defines base URLs for different environments (local, staging, production).
*   `tags`: Groups related API endpoints, typically aligned with backend modules (e.g., `Authentication`, `UserManagement`, `ContentManagement`, `NotesService`, `SubscriptionBilling`, `ProtocolEngine`, `Webhooks`).
*   `paths`: Defines all available API endpoints, including:
    *   HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    *   Parameters (path, query, header).
    *   `requestBody`: Describes the payload for POST/PUT requests.
    *   `responses`: Defines possible HTTP status codes and their corresponding response schemas (including success and error responses).
    *   `security`: Specifies the required authentication/authorization schemes for the endpoint.
    *   `summary`, `description`, `tags`: For organization and clarity.
*   `components`: Defines reusable elements:
    *   `schemas`: Data models for request bodies and response payloads (based on `database_plan.md` and API Resources).
    *   `securitySchemes`: Defines authentication methods (e.g., Bearer Token).
    *   `responses`: Reusable response definitions (e.g., standard error responses).
    *   `parameters`: Reusable parameter definitions.

**4. Authentication (Laravel Sanctum/Passport)**

*   **Method:** Bearer Token authentication via Laravel Sanctum (preferred for SPAs/mobile apps) or Passport.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Define a `securityScheme` named `bearerAuth` (or similar) of type `http` and scheme `bearer` in `components/securitySchemes`.
    *   Endpoints requiring authentication will include a `security` section referencing this scheme: `security: [{ bearerAuth: [] }]`.
    *   Login (`/api/login`) and registration (`/api/register`) endpoints will describe how to obtain the token in their response descriptions.

**5. Authorization & Feature Gating (Premium Features)**

*   **Enforcement:** All authorization and feature gating logic (checking for active premium subscriptions) is implemented **on the backend** (via Middleware, Policies, Service checks based on `SubscriptionBilling` module). The API documentation *reflects* these requirements but does not enforce them.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Endpoints or specific operations requiring a Premium subscription will be clearly marked.
    *   **Method 1 (Description):** Use the `summary` or `description` field to explicitly state "Requires active Premium subscription."
    *   **Method 2 (Custom Extension - Optional):** Use a custom extension like `x-premium-required: true` on the path item or operation object for machine-readable indication, if desired.
    *   A standard `403 Forbidden` response schema (`#/components/responses/ForbiddenError`) will be referenced for cases where a non-premium user attempts to access a premium feature.

**6. Endpoint Structure & Key Areas (Based on Modules)**

Endpoints will be grouped using tags matching the modules defined in `component_breakdown.md`.

*   **`Authentication` Tag:**
    *   `POST /api/register`
    *   `POST /api/login`
    *   `POST /api/logout` (Requires `bearerAuth`)
    *   Password Reset endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/forgot-password`, `POST /api/reset-password`)
*   **`UserManagement` Tag:**
    *   `GET /api/user/profile` (Requires `bearerAuth`)
    *   `PUT /api/user/profile` (Requires `bearerAuth`)
*   **`SubscriptionBilling` Tag:**
    *   `GET /api/plans` (Lists available subscription plans - Free/Premium)
    *   `GET /api/user/subscription` (Gets current user's subscription status - Requires `bearerAuth`)
    *   Potentially endpoints to initiate checkout (provider-dependent) or fetch portal links.
*   **`ContentManagement` Tag:**
    *   `GET /api/episodes` (List episodes)
    *   `GET /api/episodes/{id}` (Get episode details, potentially including summaries)
    *   `GET /api/protocols` (List protocols - response may differ for free/premium users, documented in description)
    *   `GET /api/protocols/{id}` (Get protocol details - response details may differ, e.g., full implementation guide only for premium, documented in description)
    *   `GET /api/summaries` (Potentially filtered by episode/protocol)
*   **`NotesService` Tag:**
    *   `GET /api/notes` (List user's notes, requires `bearerAuth`)
    *   `POST /api/notes` (Create note, requires `bearerAuth` - premium limits described)
    *   `GET /api/notes/{id}` (Get specific note, requires `bearerAuth` + ownership policy check)
    *   `PUT /api/notes/{id}` (Update note, requires `bearerAuth` + ownership policy check)
    *   `DELETE /api/notes/{id}` (Delete note, requires `bearerAuth` + ownership policy check)
    *   `GET /api/episodes/{id}/public-notes` (Fetch public notes for an episode - premium feature for *viewing* or tied to note creator being premium? Clarify requirement.)
*   **`ProtocolEngine` Tag (Primarily Premium):**
    *   `GET /api/reminders` (Requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
    *   `POST /api/reminders` (Requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
    *   `PUT /api/reminders/{id}` (Requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
    *   `DELETE /api/reminders/{id}` (Requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
    *   `POST /api/tracking/log` (Log adherence, requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
    *   `GET /api/tracking/summary` (Get tracking data/streaks, requires `bearerAuth`, documented as Premium)
*   **`Webhooks` Tag:**
    *   `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`
    *   `POST /api/webhooks/apple`
    *   `POST /api/webhooks/google`
    *   (These endpoints *do not* use `bearerAuth`. Security is via signature verification, which should be noted in the description. Request bodies will match provider specifications).

**7. Request/Response Schemas (`components/schemas`)**

*   Define reusable schemas for all major data entities (`User`, `Episode`, `Protocol`, `Summary`, `Note`, `Plan`, `Subscription`, `Reminder`, `TrackingLog`, etc.) based on `database_plan.md` and how data is structured for the API (using Laravel API Resources).
*   Define standard success response wrappers if needed (e.g., `{ "data": <Schema> }`).
*   Define standard error response schemas (see below).

**8. Error Handling**

*   **Standard Structure:** Define a consistent error response structure. Example:
    ```yaml
    ErrorResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
          description: General error message.
        errors: # Optional: Only for validation errors (422)
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          description: Field-specific validation errors.
    ```
*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Document standard usage:
    *   `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT, DELETE.
    *   `201 Created`: Successful POST.
    *   `204 No Content`: Successful DELETE where no body is returned.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Generic client error (e.g., malformed JSON, invalid parameters not caught by validation).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication token.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated user lacks permission (e.g., policy failure, non-premium user accessing premium feature).
    *   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
    *   `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Validation errors (use `errors` field in response).
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server-side error.
*   **Reusable Responses:** Define common error responses in `components/responses` (e.g., `NotFound`, `Unauthorized`, `Forbidden`, `ValidationError`, `InternalServerError`) referencing the `ErrorResponse` schema.

**9. API Versioning**

*   Implement API versioning from the start, likely via a URL prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). Include this prefix in the `servers` definition.

**10. Maintenance and Governance**

*   The `openapi.yaml` file MUST be checked into version control (Git).
*   Pull requests modifying API-related backend code SHOULD include corresponding updates to the `openapi.yaml` file.
*   Regular reviews and validation checks (manual or automated) are necessary to keep the documentation accurate and useful.

**11. Outcome**

The final deliverable is a comprehensive, version-controlled `openapi.yaml` file located in the project repository root or a designated `/docs` directory. This file serves as the definitive contract for the Huberman App's RESTful API.

**1. App Name**

Huberman App (Suggested Name)

**2. Introduction/Executive Summary**

The Huberman App is designed as a dedicated companion tool for listeners of the Huberman Lab podcast. Its core purpose is to bridge the gap between listening to the podcast and effectively implementing its science-backed health and performance protocols into daily life. It achieves this by providing structured guidance, actionable reminders, learning resources, progress tracking, and community features, addressing the challenge of translating extensive podcast information into consistent practice.

**3. Target Audience**

The app is intended for listeners and followers ("acolytes") of the Huberman Lab podcast who are motivated to apply the scientific protocols discussed to improve their health, well-being, performance, and overall lifestyle.

**4. Key Features**

The app operates on a Freemium model, offering both free core functionalities and an expanded Premium tier via subscription:

**Free Tier Features:**

*   **Basic Protocol Reminders:** Access pre-set reminders for a limited selection of foundational daily protocols (e.g., Morning Sunlight Exposure).
*   **Limited Content Access:** View short summaries and brief explanations for the foundational protocols available in the free tier.
*   **Basic Personal Notes:** Take simple personal notes linked only to the free content/protocols.
*   **Introduction & Onboarding:** Guided introduction to the app's purpose and basic features.

**Premium Tier Features (Subscription Required):**

*   **Comprehensive Protocol Library & Reminders:**
    *   Access reminders and content for the *full range* of protocols covered in the podcast (Sleep, Focus, Fitness, Nutrition, Mental Health, etc.).
    *   Fully *customizable reminders* (timing, frequency, snooze, grouping).
*   **Full Content Access & Depth:**
    *   Access both *succinct summaries* and *detailed, long-form explanations* for all protocols.
    *   Step-by-step implementation guides and practical tips.
    *   Curated links to relevant resources or papers mentioned (where feasible).
    *   Distilled key takeaways ("epiphanic summaries") for episodes/protocols.
*   **Advanced Note-Taking & Community:**
    *   Unlimited personal note-taking across all content with advanced organization (tags, search).
    *   Ability to *publicly post notes/takeaways* linked to specific episodes (community sharing).
    *   Potential for structured community discussions around protocols (moderated).
*   **Tracking & Personalization:**
    *   Tools to *track adherence* and consistency with selected protocols.
    *   Visualizations of progress and streaks.
    *   Create *personalized routines* or "stacks" combining multiple protocols for specific goals.
*   **Offline Access:** Download content (summaries, guides, notes) for offline use.
*   **Early Access & Updates:** Receive new protocols, content, and features as they are released.
*   **Ad-Free Experience:** Guaranteed free from any advertising.

**5. Core Functionality/How it Works**

The app serves as a centralized hub for Huberman Lab protocol knowledge and implementation. It takes complex information from the podcast and transforms it into actionable steps through reminders and structured guides (basic access free, full access premium). It supports learning via layered content (summaries/detailed explanations) and facilitates habit formation through reminders and tracking tools (premium). Users can personalize their experience through notes (basic free, advanced/public premium) and tailor routines (premium).

**6. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)/Why This App?**

*   **Simplifies Implementation:** Makes applying scientifically-grounded protocols significantly easier and more consistent.
*   **Consolidated & Structured Resource:** Organizes vast amounts of podcast information into an accessible, actionable format.
*   **Facilitates Learning & Practice:** Allows users to learn the science while receiving practical guidance on implementation.
*   **Personalization & Tracking (Premium):** Enables users to tailor protocols to their goals and monitor their progress.
*   **Community Engagement (Premium):** Offers a platform for shared learning and insights among dedicated users.

**7. Monetization Strategy**

The app utilizes a **Freemium model**. Core functionality and limited content are available for free to ensure basic accessibility. Full access to all features, comprehensive content, advanced personalization, tracking, and community functions requires a **Premium Subscription** (offered on a monthly or annual basis). This model supports ongoing development, content updates, and app maintenance while providing significant value to dedicated users. Intrusive advertising or selling user data are explicitly avoided to maintain user trust and align with the app's wellness focus.

**8. Potential Future Features/Ideas (Based on Initial Notes)**

*   Incorporating relevant content and insights from experts associated with Andrew Huberman ("Band of Brothers and Sistas").
*   Continued distillation and addition of practices from related talks, interviews, and research papers.

**9. Technical Considerations (Based on Initial Notes)**

*   **Platform:** Primarily envisioned as a mobile application for iOS and Android platforms ("downloadable").

**10. User Considerations/Concerns Mentioned (Based on Initial Notes)**

*   **Habit Formation:** Awareness that over-reliance on reminders could potentially hinder conscious habit internalization (though the app aims to support, not replace, conscious effort).
*   **Accessibility:** The Freemium model aims to address financial accessibility concerns by providing core value for free, while the subscription funds the full, advanced feature set.

**Final Architectural Plan (v3): Optimize Guide: Huberman Companion App (with Detailed Monetization Features)**

**1. Executive Summary of Architectural Proposal**

This document outlines the finalized technical architecture for the "Optimize Guide: Huberman Companion" mobile application, designed to support a **Freemium model with tiered Subscriptions (Monthly/Annual)**. The architecture facilitates distinct **Free** (limited foundational protocols/summaries, basic notes) and **Premium** (comprehensive library, customizable reminders, detailed content, advanced notes/community, tracking, offline access) feature sets. It employs a **Modular Monolith** backend (**Laravel/PHP**), **PostgreSQL 17** database, **Redis** cache/queues, and a **React Native** frontend. Communication uses a **RESTful API**. Deployment leverages managed **Laravel hosting (Forge/Vapor)**, with **Docker** for local development. Key architectural components include robust user subscription management, secure feature gating via API middleware, and integration with mobile In-App Purchase (IAP) systems.

**2. Analysis of App Requirements & Architectural Drivers**

*(Requirements updated to reflect specific tiered features)*

- **Content Delivery & Management:** Efficient storage, management, and delivery of structured content. **Access control based on subscription tier is critical:**
    - *Free:* Limited protocol summaries/explanations.
    - *Premium:* Full library access (all protocols, detailed explanations, implementation guides, research links, key takeaways).
- **User Interaction & Data:** User authentication, creation of notes, potential public sharing. **Tiered feature access:**
    - *Free:* Basic notes linked to free content only.
    - *Premium:* Unlimited notes across all content, advanced organization, public notes/discussion features.
- **Actionable Guidance & Reminders:** Reliable push notification system. **Tiered functionality:**
    - *Free:* Pre-set, non-customizable reminders for a limited protocol set.
    - *Premium:* Comprehensive, customizable reminders (timing, frequency, grouping) for all protocols, potential location awareness.
- **Tracking & Personalization (Premium):** Tools for tracking adherence, progress visualization, and creating personalized protocol stacks.
- **Offline Access (Premium):** Ability to download content and notes.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile:** Target iOS and Android using React Native.
- **Scalability:** Potential for significant user growth requires scalable reads, writes, notifications, and **efficient subscription/entitlement checks**.
- **Maintainability & Evolvability:** Modular design to accommodate future content, features, and subscription changes.
- **Development Efficiency:** Leverage Laravel/React Native.
- **User Experience:** Responsive interface, clear distinction between free/premium, seamless upgrade process, **ad-free experience (Premium)**.
- **Monetization:** Implement the defined Freemium model with secure payment processing and access control.

*Non-Functional Drivers:* Performance, Security (incl. Payment Security), Reliability, Cost-Effectiveness, User Trust & Transparency.

**3. Proposed Architecture Pattern(s)**

- **Recommendation:** **Modular Monolith** for the backend.
- **Justification:** Remains suitable. Facilitates integrating subscription logic and **feature gating** within relevant modules (e.g., `Users`, `Billing`, domain-specific feature modules) while maintaining structure.

**4. Technology Stack Recommendation**

*(Highlighting feature gating aspects)*

- **Frontend (Mobile):**
    - **Technology:** **React Native**
    - **Justification:** Cross-platform. Requires **IAP libraries** (`react-native-iap`). UI must **conditionally render features/content/prompts** based on user subscription status received from the backend.
- **Backend:**
    - **Technology:** **Laravel (PHP 8.x+)**
    - **Justification:** Rapid development. Needs integration with **payment gateways (Stripe/Paddle via SDKs, potentially Laravel Cashier)** and **server-side IAP receipt validation**. **Crucially, must implement robust feature gating mechanisms (e.g., Policies, Middleware, dedicated service classes) to enforce access based on user's active subscription plan.**
- **Database:**
    - **Technology:** **PostgreSQL 17**
    - **Justification:** Robust storage. Schema includes `users`, `plans`, `subscriptions` tables to track user entitlements.
- **Cache / Queues:**
    - **Technology:** **Redis**
    - **Justification:** Caching (API responses, **user entitlement flags**), efficient queue driver (notifications, post-payment processing).
- **APIs & Communication:**
    - **Technology:** **RESTful API over HTTPS**
    - **Justification:** Standard communication. API endpoints serving premium features/data **must be protected by middleware** verifying active premium subscription status. Endpoints needed for fetching subscription offers, managing subscriptions (via provider portals or limited API), and **receiving payment webhooks**.
- **Payment Processing:**
    - **Recommendation:** **Stripe** or **Paddle**
    - **Justification:** Handle subscription logic, compliance, SDKs, IAP integration.

**5. Data Model Considerations**

- **Core Entities:** `User`, `Episode`, `Protocol`, `Summary`, `Note`, `Plan`, `Subscription`, `ContentSource`. (Schema details provided previously).
- **Feature Gating Logic:** Access checks will typically query the `subscriptions` table (joined with `users` and potentially `plans`) to verify if a user has an `active` subscription linked to a premium `Plan`. This logic resides primarily in the backend (API middleware/policies).
- **Challenges:** Keeping local subscription status synced accurately; handling complex subscription states; efficiently querying entitlements for API requests.

**6. Scalability and Performance Strategy**

- **Horizontal Backend Scaling:** As before (Forge/Vapor). Optimize subscription checks (e.g., cache user's plan ID and status in Redis for TTL).
- **Database Scaling:** As before.
- **Caching:** Aggressively cache user permission/subscription status; cache `Plan` details; cache non-personalized content.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Use **Laravel Queues** for notifications, payment webhook processing, entitlement updates, subscription lifecycle emails.
- **CDN:** As before.

**7. Security Considerations**

- **Authentication:** As before (Sanctum/Passport).
- **Authorization:** **Critical.** Implement robust authorization (Laravel Middleware/Policies) verifying subscription status *before* granting access to premium API endpoints, features (e.g., creating > X notes, accessing detailed summaries), or data. Prevent client-side bypasses.
- **Payment Security:** As before (Rely on providers, secure keys, server-side IAP validation, webhook security).
- **Data Privacy:** As before.
- **Input Validation:** As before.
- **API Security:** As before.
- **Dependency Management:** As before.

**8. Deployment Strategy & Infrastructure**

- **Cloud Provider / Deployment Management / DB / Cache:** As before (Forge/Vapor, Managed PostgreSQL/Redis).
- **Local Development:** Docker setup remains the same.
- **CI/CD:** As before. **Include tests specifically verifying feature gating logic for different user subscription states.**
- **Webhooks:** As before (secure endpoints needed).
- **Storage:** As before (S3/GCS, especially for potential offline content downloads in premium).

**9. Potential Challenges & Trade-offs**

*(Refined based on feature detail)*

- **Complexity of Subscription Logic & Syncing:** Remains the primary complexity driver.
- **Robust Feature Gating Implementation:** Ensuring access control is correctly and consistently applied across all relevant features/endpoints requires careful implementation and testing. Mistakes here directly impact revenue and user trust.
- **IAP Integration:** Remains complex due to platform specifics.
- **Content Pipeline:** Remains an operational challenge.
- **Monolith Rigidity:** Risk still exists if modularity isn't maintained.
- **Cross-Platform Nuances (React Native):** As before.
- **Notification Reliability:** As before.
- **User Experience:** **Maintaining a compelling free tier while clearly showcasing premium value without being intrusive is a key design challenge.** Smooth upgrade flow is vital.

**10. Recommendations for Next Steps**

1. **Refine Feature Scope (Free vs. Premium):** *Considered complete based on provided input.*
2. **Detailed Domain Modeling:** *Schema provided previously.* Create migrations.
3. **API Contract Definition:** Define all endpoints, clearly marking which require premium access and how status is checked/returned.
4. **Setup Local Docker Environment:** As before.
5. **Choose & Configure Hosting/Payment:** As before. Set up plans matching the Free/Premium tiers in Stripe/Paddle and App Stores.
6. **Implement Core Backend Logic:** Build Auth, basic CRUD, **subscription management (Cashier recommended)**, and **implement core feature gating middleware/policies based on the defined tiers.**
7. **Frontend PoC (React Native):** Build core UI, **integrate IAP**, **implement conditional rendering based on subscription status**, basic purchase flow.
8. **Implement Webhook Handling:** As before.
9. **Content Strategy Definition:** As before.
10. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline:** Include **feature gating tests**.

# Huberman App: Backend Implementation TODO Checklist (TDD Approach)

**Project Goal:** Implement the Laravel backend for the Huberman App, supporting a Freemium model, content delivery, user interactions, reminders, tracking, and subscription management, ready for production deployment.

**Development Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) will be used. For each functional component, write tests *first* to define expected behavior, then implement the code to make the tests pass, and finally refactor.

**Legend:**
*   `[ ]` - To Do
*   `[x]` - Done
*   `(TDD)` - Indicates steps where writing tests *before* implementation is paramount.

## Phase 5: Feature Gating Implementation (Milestone 4 & 5 - TDD Focus)

*   **Subscription Service Logic:**
    *   `[ ]` (TDD) Write unit tests for `SubscriptionService::userHasActivePremiumSubscription` covering different scenarios: no subscription, free plan, active premium, trialing premium, canceled premium (before/after `ends_at`), expired, past_due. Use factories to set up test data.
    *   `[ ]` Implement the actual logic in `SubscriptionService` querying the `subscriptions` table, joining `plans`, checking status (`active`, `trialing`) and `ends_at`.
    *   `[ ]` (TDD) Test caching logic: test that a cache hit avoids DB query, test cache miss populates cache, test cache TTL.
    *   `[ ]` Implement caching layer within `userHasActivePremiumSubscription` (using `Cache::remember`).

*   **Middleware:**
    *   `[ ]` (TDD) Write feature tests applying `CheckPremiumAccess` middleware to a test route: test authenticated premium user passes, authenticated free user gets 403, unauthenticated user gets 401 (handled by `auth:sanctum`).
    *   `[ ]` Implement `CheckPremiumAccess` middleware using the `SubscriptionServiceInterface`.
    *   `[ ]` Register middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
    *   `[ ]` Apply middleware to relevant premium API route groups (initially, maybe just the premium content routes). Ensure tests pass.

*   **Gated Content API:**
    *   `[ ]` (TDD) Write API tests specifically testing that premium content (e.g., full protocol details including `implementation_guide`) is *only* returned to authenticated, premium users, while free users get limited data or 403 (decide strategy).
    *   `[ ]` Refactor Content API endpoints/service to incorporate checks (either via middleware or conditional logic based on `userHasActivePremiumSubscription`) and return data accordingly. Use API Resources to conditionally load attributes. Ensure tests pass.

---

## Phase 6: Full Subscription Lifecycle via Webhooks (Milestone 4 - TDD Focus)

*   **Webhook Processing Logic:**
    *   `[ ]` For each key Stripe event handled by Cashier or needing custom handling (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated` [trial end, cancel, reactivate], `customer.subscription.deleted`):
        *   `[ ]` (TDD) Write tests simulating the webhook: Assert DB state changes (`subscriptions.status`, `ends_at`, `trial_ends_at`) are correct. Assert appropriate internal Laravel Events are dispatched (use `Event::fake()`).
        *   `[ ]` Implement logic within Cashier event listeners *or* extend `WebhookController`/`SubscriptionService::handleWebhook` if not fully covered by Cashier.
    *   `[ ]` Implement IAP (Apple/Google) server-side receipt validation logic (if applicable, using libraries or HTTP calls). Test validation.
    *   `[ ]` Implement webhook handling/notification processing for Apple/Google events, mapping them to internal states (`trialing`, `active`, `canceled`, `expired`, `past_due`). Test state transitions.

*   **Cache Invalidation:**
    *   `[ ]` (TDD) Write tests ensuring that listeners for `Subscription*` events (e.g., `SubscriptionRenewed`, `SubscriptionCanceled`, `SubscriptionExpired`) clear the relevant user's premium status cache (`user:{id}:is_premium`).
    *   `[ ]` Create Event Listeners that clear the cache upon relevant subscription state changes. Register listeners. Ensure tests pass.

---

## Phase 7: Implementing MVP Features (Milestone 5 & 6 Prep - TDD Focus)

*   **Free Tier - Basic Reminders:**

**Huberman App: Backend Component Breakdown (Modular Monolith)**

**1. Introduction**

This document details the proposed modular structure for the Huberman App's Laravel backend, following the Modular Monolith pattern outlined in the architecture and implementation plan (`architecture_pan.md`, `detailed_plan.md`). The goal is to organize the codebase into distinct, domain-focused modules (represented as namespaces/folders within the `app/` directory) to improve maintainability, scalability, and clarity of responsibilities. While running as a single application, these logical boundaries help manage complexity as the application grows.

Each module will encapsulate its specific domain logic, including Models, Controllers (for API endpoints related to the module), Services, Events, Listeners, Policies, Requests, etc.

**2. Proposed Backend Modules**

The initial set of proposed modules, located under `app/Modules/`, are:

*   **`app/Modules/Authentication`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Handles user registration, login (authentication), password reset functionality, API token issuance and potentially revocation (e.g., integrating Laravel Sanctum or Passport).
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` (Handles API login, register, logout, etc.)
        *   `Http/Controllers/PasswordResetController.php` (Handles password reset flow)
        *   `Http/Requests/LoginRequest.php`, `RegisterRequest.php`
        *   Potentially `Services/AuthService.php` for complex logic.
        *   Related Routes definition.
        *   Authentication-related Middleware (e.g., `EnsureTokenIsValid`).

*   **`app/Modules/UserManagement`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages user data beyond authentication, such as profile information (name, potentially picture), user settings, and serves as the owner of the core `User` model. It collaborates with `SubscriptionBilling` to understand a user's access level.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Models/User.php` (The core Eloquent User model)
        *   `Http/Controllers/UserController.php` (API for fetching/updating user profile)
        *   `Http/Requests/UpdateProfileRequest.php`
        *   `Services/UserService.php`
        *   `Policies/UserPolicy.php` (Authorization for profile actions)
        *   Database migrations for the `users` table.

*   **`app/Modules/SubscriptionBilling`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages subscription plans (`Plan` model), tracks user subscriptions (`Subscription` model), integrates with payment providers (Stripe/Paddle via Cashier), handles incoming webhooks for payment events (success, failure, cancellation), and provides the core logic for checking a user's subscription status and entitlements (feature gating).
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Models/Plan.php`
        *   `Models/Subscription.php`
        *   `Http/Controllers/SubscriptionController.php` (API for fetching plans, potentially initiating checkout flows)
        *   `Http/Controllers/WebhookController.php` (Handles Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google webhooks)
        *   `Services/BillingService.php` or `SubscriptionService.php` (Core logic for status checks, webhook processing)
        *   `Policies/SubscriptionPolicy.php` or Middleware (e.g., `CheckPremiumAccess`) - *Crucial for Feature Gating*.
        *   Listeners for Cashier events (if applicable).
        *   Database migrations for `plans`, `subscriptions` tables.

*   **`app/Modules/ContentManagement`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages the core application content: Podcast Episodes, Protocols, Summaries, Key Takeaways. Includes logic for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting this content (potentially via admin interfaces or seeders) and exposing it through the API, respecting access levels determined by `SubscriptionBilling`.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Models/Episode.php`, `Protocol.php`, `Summary.php`
        *   `Http/Controllers/EpisodeController.php` (API for episodes)
        *   `Http/Controllers/ProtocolController.php` (API for protocols)
        *   `Http/Controllers/SummaryController.php` (API for summaries)
        *   `Services/ContentService.php` (May handle complex queries or formatting)
        *   Database migrations for `episodes`, `protocols`, `summaries`, `episode_protocol` tables.
        *   Potentially Resource Collections for API responses.

*   **`app/Modules/ProtocolEngine`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Handles the *application* of protocols, primarily focusing on the reminder and tracking features (Premium). Includes logic for setting/managing user-defined reminders, scheduling notifications, and recording user adherence to protocols.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Http/Controllers/ReminderController.php` (API for CRUD operations on user reminders - Premium)
        *   `Http/Controllers/TrackingController.php` (API for logging protocol adherence - Premium)
        *   `Services/ReminderService.php` (Logic for scheduling/managing reminders)
        *   `Services/TrackingService.php` (Logic for recording/calculating adherence, streaks)
        *   Potentially `Models/UserReminder.php`, `Models/ProtocolTrack.php`
        *   Related `Jobs` (e.g., `SendProtocolReminderNotification`) pushed to the queue.
        *   Console Commands (e.g., for queue workers, potentially scheduling checks).
        *   Policies/Middleware to ensure only Premium users can access these features.

*   **`app/Modules/NotesService`**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages user-created notes linked to episodes. Handles CRUD operations, public/private status, and potentially organization features (tags, search - likely Premium).
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Models/Note.php`
        *   `Http/Controllers/NoteController.php` (API for note CRUD)
        *   `Services/NoteService.php`
        *   `Policies/NotePolicy.php` (Ensures users can only manage their own notes, checks Premium status for advanced features like unlimited notes or public sharing).
        *   Database migrations for the `notes` table.

*   **`app/Modules/CommunityFeatures`** (If implemented early)
    *   **Responsibilities:** Focuses on features involving multiple users interacting, such as viewing public notes associated with episodes or potential discussion forums. Relies heavily on `NotesService` (for public notes) and `SubscriptionBilling` (access control).
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `Http/Controllers/PublicContentController.php` (API for fetching public notes, etc.)
        *   Services related to fetching/aggregating community content.
        *   Policies/Middleware enforcing Premium access if applicable.

*   **`app/Modules/CoreApi`** (Potentially minimal or evolves to `SharedKernel`)
    *   **Responsibilities:** This module might be less domain-specific. Initially, it could house base API controllers, shared API traits (e.g., for standardized responses), common API middleware registration, or core exception handling for the API. Alternatively, these elements might be placed directly in `app/Http` or `app/Providers`, and this module could evolve into a `SharedKernel` for truly cross-cutting domain logic (e.g., shared interfaces, base service classes) not tied to a specific module *or* the HTTP layer. API controllers for specific domains (`User`, `Content`, `Note`, etc.) reside within their respective modules (`UserManagement`, `ContentManagement`, `NotesService`).
    *   **Key Components (Potential):**
        *   `Http/Controllers/Api/BaseApiController.php`
        *   `Traits/ApiResponseHelpers.php`
        *   Centralized API middleware registration logic (if not in `app/Http/Kernel.php`).

**3. Interactions**

Modules will interact primarily through:
*   **Service Classes:** Injecting services from one module into another (e.g., `NotePolicy` using `SubscriptionService` to check status).
*   **Events and Listeners:** Decoupled communication (e.g., `SubscriptionBilling` firing `SubscriptionActivated` event, listened to by `UserManagement` or `ProtocolEngine`).
*   **Eloquent Relationships:** Defined on Models (e.g., `User` hasMany `Subscription`).

**4. Conclusion**

This modular breakdown provides a structured approach to developing the Laravel backend. It aims to create clear boundaries between different functional areas of the application, facilitating parallel development, easier testing, and long-term maintainability, while still benefiting from the simplicity of a single deployment unit (monolith).

**Huberman App: Backend Component Interfaces & Interactions**

**1. Introduction**

Following the definition of backend modules in `component_breakdown.md`, this document specifies the interfaces, contracts, and primary interaction patterns between these modules within the Laravel Modular Monolith. The goal is to ensure loose coupling where appropriate, define clear responsibilities, and illustrate how data and control flow, particularly for critical cross-cutting concerns like subscription-based feature gating.

**2. Primary Interaction Mechanisms**

Modules within the backend will primarily interact using standard Laravel patterns designed to promote maintainability and testability:

*   **Dependency Injection (DI) & Service Interfaces:** The preferred method for direct inter-module communication. Modules will define interfaces (contracts) for their core services. Other modules will type-hint these interfaces in their constructors or methods, allowing Laravel's service container to inject the concrete implementation. This decouples the modules.
*   **Events and Listeners:** Used for broadcasting significant state changes or actions without requiring the originating module to know about all interested parties. For example, when a subscription status changes, an event can be fired, and multiple listeners in different modules can react accordingly (e.g., clearing caches, enabling/disabling features).
*   **Middleware:** Used primarily for cross-cutting concerns applied at the HTTP request level, notably for authentication (handled by `Authentication` module's logic) and authorization/feature gating (checking subscription status via `SubscriptionBilling` module's logic before allowing access to specific API routes/controllers).
*   **Policies:** Used for fine-grained authorization logic, often related to specific Eloquent models. Policies within a module (e.g., `NotePolicy` in `NotesService`) can leverage services from other modules (like `SubscriptionBilling`) to make authorization decisions.
*   **Eloquent Relationships:** Models defined within modules will use standard Eloquent relationships (`hasMany`, `belongsTo`, etc.) to interact with models in other modules where direct data relationships exist (e.g., `User` model in `UserManagement` has many `Subscription` models in `SubscriptionBilling`).

**3. Key Module Interfaces & Service Contracts**

Here are *examples* of key interfaces or service methods that modules might expose or consume. Concrete implementations will reside within the respective modules.

*   **`Authentication` Module:**
    *   *Primarily Consumed:* Consumes `UserManagement` services/models for user lookup/creation.
    *   *Exposes:* Less direct service interfaces, more functionality via controllers and standard Laravel Auth mechanisms (e.g., `Auth::user()`).
    *   *Fires Events:* `UserRegistered`, `UserLoggedIn`, `PasswordResetRequested`.

*   **`UserManagement` Module:**
    *   *Exposes:*
        *   `App\Modules\UserManagement\Models\User` (The core User model, accessible throughout the application).
        *   Potentially `UserServiceInterface` for complex profile operations (if needed beyond simple CRUD).
    *   *Listens To Events:* Potentially `SubscriptionStatusChanged` (from `SubscriptionBilling`) to update cached user properties if necessary.

*   **`SubscriptionBilling` Module:**
    *   *Exposes (Crucial Interfaces):*
        *   `SubscriptionServiceInterface`:
            *   `userHasActivePremiumSubscription(User $user): bool` - *Core method for feature gating.*
            *   `getUserPlan(User $user): ?Plan`
            *   `getSubscriptionStatus(User $user): string`
            *   `handleWebhook(string $provider, array $payload): void` (Internal logic invoked by WebhookController).
            *   Methods to retrieve plan details for the frontend API.
        *   `Models\Plan`, `Models\Subscription`.
    *   *Consumes:* `UserManagement` (for `User` model).
    *   *Fires Events:* `SubscriptionStarted`, `SubscriptionRenewed`, `SubscriptionCanceled`, `SubscriptionExpired`, `PaymentFailed`, `TrialWillEndSoon`.

*   **`ContentManagement` Module:**
    *   *Exposes:*
        *   `ContentServiceInterface` (or specific interfaces like `EpisodeServiceInterface`, `ProtocolServiceInterface`):
            *   `getFreeTierProtocols(): Collection`
            *   `getAllProtocols(): Collection`
            *   `getProtocolDetails(int $protocolId): ?Protocol`
            *   `getEpisodeSummaries(int $episodeId): Collection`
            *   `getEpisodeDetails(int $episodeId): ?Episode`
        *   `Models\Episode`, `Models\Protocol`, `Models\Summary`.
    *   *Consumes:* May indirectly use `SubscriptionBilling` (via middleware/policies applied to its controllers) to restrict access to certain data retrieval methods/endpoints.

*   **`ProtocolEngine` Module:**
    *   *Exposes:*
        *   `ReminderServiceInterface`:
            *   `setReminder(User $user, int $protocolId, array $settings): UserReminder` (Requires premium check internally).
            *   `getUserReminders(User $user): Collection`
            *   `deleteReminder(User $user, int $reminderId): bool`
        *   `TrackingServiceInterface`:
            *   `logAdherence(User $user, int $protocolId, Carbon $date): ProtocolTrack` (Requires premium check internally).
            *   `getUserTrackingData(User $user, DateRange $range): array`
            *   `calculateStreaks(User $user, int $protocolId): int`
    *   *Consumes:*
        *   `SubscriptionServiceInterface` (to perform internal premium checks before executing actions).
        *   `UserManagement` (for `User` model).
        *   `ContentManagement` (for `Protocol` model details).
    *   *Listens To Events:* Potentially `SubscriptionExpired` (to disable active reminders if needed).

*   **`NotesService` Module:**
    *   *Exposes:*
        *   `NoteServiceInterface`:
            *   `createNote(User $user, int $episodeId, string $content, bool $isPublic = false): Note` (Checks limits/public permission).
            *   `updateNote(User $user, int $noteId, array $data): Note`
            *   `deleteNote(User $user, int $noteId): bool`
            *   `getUserNotes(User $user, ?int $episodeId = null): Collection`
            *   `getPublicNotesForEpisode(int $episodeId): Collection`
        *   `Models\Note`.
    *   *Consumes:*
        *   `SubscriptionServiceInterface` (within its policies/services to check free tier limits or premium permission for public notes/advanced features).
        *   `UserManagement` (for `User`).
        *   `ContentManagement` (for `Episode`).

*   **`CommunityFeatures` Module:**
    *   *Consumes:*
        *   `NoteServiceInterface` (to fetch public notes).
        *   `SubscriptionServiceInterface` (via middleware/policies to control access to community sections if they are premium).
        *   `UserManagement` (for user details).

**4. Key Interaction Flow Examples (Sequence Diagrams - Conceptual)**

*   **Flow 1: User Accesses Premium Protocol Details (API Request)**
    1.  `React Native App` -> `API Request (GET /api/protocols/{id})`
    2.  `Laravel Router` -> `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware`
    3.  `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware` -> `Auth` (Get Authenticated User)
    4.  `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware` -> `SubscriptionServiceInterface::userHasActivePremiumSubscription(User)`
    5.  `SubscriptionService` -> `Database/Cache` (Check `subscriptions` table for User) -> Returns `true`
    6.  `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware` -> `Allows Request`
    7.  `Laravel Router` -> `ProtocolController::show(protocolId)`
    8.  `ProtocolController` -> `ProtocolServiceInterface::getProtocolDetails(protocolId)`
    9.  `ProtocolService` -> `Database` (Fetch Protocol data)
    10. `ProtocolController` -> `Format Response` (e.g., using API Resource)
    11. `Laravel` -> `API Response (200 OK with Protocol Data)` -> `React Native App`

*   **Flow 2: User Sets a Custom Reminder (API Request - Premium Feature)**
    1.  `React Native App` -> `API Request (POST /api/reminders)` with protocol ID, time settings.
    2.  `Laravel Router` -> `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware`
    3.  `CheckPremiumAccess Middleware` -> ... (verifies premium as in Flow 1) -> `Allows Request`
    4.  `Laravel Router` -> `ReminderController::store(Request)`
    5.  `ReminderController` -> `SetReminderRequest` (Validation)
    6.  `ReminderController` -> `ReminderServiceInterface::setReminder(User, protocolId, settings)`
    7.  *(Defense-in-depth): `ReminderService` -> `SubscriptionServiceInterface::userHasActivePremiumSubscription(User)` -> Returns `true`*
    8.  `ReminderService` -> `Database` (Save `UserReminder` record)
    9.  `ReminderService` -> `Queue::dispatch(new ScheduleReminderJob(reminderId))` (Optional: If scheduling is complex)
    10. `ReminderController` -> `Format Response (201 Created)`
    11. `Laravel` -> `API Response` -> `React Native App`

*   **Flow 3: Payment Provider Webhook (Subscription Renewed)**
    1.  `Stripe/Paddle/App Store` -> `POST /api/webhooks/{provider}`
    2.  `Laravel Router` -> `WebhookController::handle(provider, Request)`
    3.  `WebhookController` -> `VerifyWebhookSignature Middleware/Logic`
    4.  `WebhookController` -> `SubscriptionServiceInterface::handleWebhook(provider, payload)`
    5.  `SubscriptionService` -> `Parse Payload` (Identify event type: e.g., `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `subscription.updated`)
    6.  `SubscriptionService` -> `Database` (Find corresponding `User` and `Subscription` record)
    7.  `SubscriptionService` -> `Database` (Update `Subscription` status, `ends_at` date)
    8.  `SubscriptionService` -> `Event::dispatch(new SubscriptionRenewed(Subscription))`
    9.  `SubscriptionRenewed Listener 1` (e.g., `ClearUserEntitlementCache`) -> `Cache::forget(...)`
    10. `SubscriptionRenewed Listener 2` (e.g., `SendRenewalConfirmationEmail`) -> `Queue::dispatch(...)` (Optional)
    11. `WebhookController` -> `Return Success Response (200 OK)` -> `Payment Provider`

**5. Frontend Interaction Summary**

The React Native frontend interacts with the backend *exclusively* through the defined RESTful API. It is unaware of the internal module structure, service interfaces, or events. The backend API is responsible for:
*   Authenticating the user.
*   Performing all necessary authorization and feature gating based on subscription status.
*   Returning data appropriate to the user's access level (e.g., filtering content, including flags like `is_premium_user: true` or `can_set_reminders: true`).
*   Accepting requests and triggering the relevant backend logic.

**6. Conclusion**

Defining clear interfaces (primarily through PHP Interfaces for Services) and interaction patterns (DI, Events, Middleware, Policies) allows for a decoupled yet cohesive Modular Monolith. This structure facilitates understanding responsibilities, enhances testability (by mocking dependencies), and enables more organized development and maintenance of the Huberman App backend. The key cross-cutting concern of subscription checking is handled systematically via middleware and service calls, ensuring consistent feature gating.

**Huberman App: Initial Content Strategy & Management Plan**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the strategy for sourcing, preparing, and ingesting the initial content required for the Huberman App backend, particularly for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This includes foundational protocols, summaries, and other necessary data points defined in `app_description.md` and `user_stories_mvp.md`. The goal is to establish a clear process for populating the database using Laravel Seeders.

**2. Initial Content Scope (MVP Focus)**

Based on the MVP definition, the initial content required includes:

*   **Subscription Plans:** Definition of the "Free" tier and at least one "Premium" tier (e.g., Monthly/Annual) with their identifiers (e.g., `Premium_Monthly`). Provider-specific IDs (Stripe, Apple, Google) will be needed later but placeholders can be used initially in seeders.
*   **Foundational Protocols:** A selected subset of core protocols discussed frequently in the Huberman Lab podcast (e.g., Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cold Exposure, Foundational Fitness Protocols). For each:
    *   Unique Name
    *   Category (e.g., Sleep, Focus, Fitness)
    *   Brief Description (Accessible to Free users)
    *   *(Optional MVP)* Placeholder/basic Implementation Guide (Premium access)
*   **Summaries for Foundational Protocols:** Concise summaries linked to the foundational protocols above.
*   **Placeholder Episodes:** A few basic episode entries might be needed to link summaries and notes to, even if full episode data isn't part of the MVP content focus.

**3. Content Source & Curation**

*   **Source Material:** The primary source for protocol and summary content will be the public Huberman Lab podcast episodes and potentially official associated materials (e.g., summaries on the Huberman Lab website, newsletters).
*   **Curation Process:**
    *   **Responsibility:** A designated **"Content Curator"** role is required. This role is responsible for listening to/reviewing source material, extracting key information, writing descriptions and summaries, and ensuring scientific accuracy aligns with the source. *(This role needs to be assigned - could be a project manager, a subject matter expert, or the client)*.
    *   **Extraction:** The Curator will identify the foundational protocols for the MVP, extract their names, core principles (for description), and key takeaways (for summaries).
    *   **Writing:** The Curator will write the actual `description` and `summary` text, adhering to a consistent tone and style suitable for the app. Accuracy and clarity are paramount.

**4. Content Preparation & Formatting**

*   **Format:** Content curated should be prepared in **Markdown (`.md`)** format. This provides basic text formatting (headings, lists, bold/italic) while remaining easy for developers to parse and integrate into seeders.
*   **Structure:** Separate Markdown files should be created for each protocol and potentially each summary, or grouped logically (e.g., one file per protocol containing its description and summary). A consistent structure within the files is recommended.
    *   *Example `morning_sunlight.md` structure:*
        ```markdown
        # Protocol: Morning Sunlight Viewing

        **Category:** Sleep, Circadian Rhythm

        **Description:**
        Brief explanation of the importance of viewing sunlight shortly after waking...

        **Summary:**
        Key takeaway points about the protocol...

        **(Premium) Implementation Guide:**
        Step-by-step guide (can be basic/placeholder for MVP)...
        ```
*   **Review:** Before handing off to development, the curated and formatted Markdown content should be reviewed for accuracy, clarity, consistency, and typos (potentially by another team member or the client).

**5. Ingestion Format (for Seeders)**

*   **Method:** The prepared content will be directly embedded into PHP arrays within dedicated Laravel Seeder classes (e.g., `FoundationalProtocolsSeeder.php`, `SummariesSeeder.php`).
*   **Rationale:** For the initial, relatively small MVP dataset, embedding directly in PHP arrays is the simplest method. It avoids the need for parsing external files (like JSON or CSV) during the seeding process. If the initial dataset becomes very large, transitioning to reading from JSON files stored alongside the seeders can be considered.
*   **Data Structure in Seeders:** The seeders will translate the Markdown content into the structure required by the Eloquent models (`Protocol`, `Summary`, `Episode`). Markdown text can be stored directly in the appropriate database fields (`description`, `content`, `implementation_guide`).

**6. Ingestion Mechanism (Laravel Seeders)**

*   **Implementation:** Backend developers will create the necessary Seeder classes within the `database/seeders/` directory.
*   **Specific Seeders:**
    *   `PlanSeeder.php`: Creates the 'Free' and 'Premium' plan records. Should use `updateOrCreate` to avoid duplicates on re-seeding.
    *   `EpisodeSeeder.php`: Creates placeholder Episode records if needed for relationships.
    *   `FoundationalProtocolsSeeder.php`: Creates the initial `Protocol` records from the prepared Markdown content.
    *   `SummariesSeeder.php`: Creates the initial `Summary` records, linking them to the appropriate `Protocol` or `Episode` IDs created in previous seeders.
    *   `EpisodeProtocolSeeder.php`: Links Episodes and Protocols in the pivot table if necessary for MVP structure.
*   **Execution:** Seeders will be executed using `php artisan db:seed`. They will be called sequentially from the main `DatabaseSeeder.php` file to ensure relational integrity (e.g., create protocols before summaries that link to them).
*   **Environment:** Seeders should be designed to run safely in development environments. Running seeders in staging/production needs careful consideration (usually only done for initial setup or specific reference data like Plans).

**7. Responsibilities**

*   **Content Curator:** Identify source material, extract information, write/format descriptions & summaries in Markdown, review for accuracy.
*   **Backend Developer:** Create/update Seeder classes, integrate Markdown content into PHP arrays within seeders, ensure seeders run correctly and populate the database as expected, handle relationships.
*   **QA / PM / Client:** Review the content *as it appears in the running application* (after seeding) to ensure it displays correctly and matches requirements.

**8. Future Content Management**

*   **Limitation of Seeders:** Seeders are primarily for initial data setup and developer environments. They are **not** a suitable mechanism for ongoing content updates by non-developers in a production environment.
*   **Post-MVP:** A separate strategy and implementation plan will be required for ongoing content management. This will likely involve developing an Admin Panel or integrating a Headless CMS to allow the Content Curator or other authorized users to add, edit, and manage protocols, episodes, and summaries without requiring code changes and deployments.

**9. Conclusion**

This plan outlines a clear process for handling the initial content load for the Huberman App MVP. By defining the source, curation process, formatting (Markdown), and ingestion mechanism (Laravel Seeders directly using PHP arrays), we can ensure the necessary foundational content is reliably populated for development, testing, and the initial launch. The need for a more robust, long-term content management solution post-MVP is acknowledged.

**Huberman App: Database Migrations Plan**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the plan for translating the conceptual SQL schema defined in `database_plan.md` into executable Laravel migration files. These migrations will provide a version-controlled, repeatable, and database-agnostic way (within Laravel's supported databases) to define and evolve the application's database structure.

**2. Process Overview**

1.  **Review SQL Schema:** Thoroughly review the `database_plan.md` file to understand table structures, data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE), foreign key relationships, `ON DELETE` behavior, and indexes.
2.  **Map SQL to Laravel Schema Builder:** Translate each `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE INDEX` statement into the corresponding Laravel `Schema` facade methods (`Schema::create`, `$table->id()`, `$table->string()`, `$table->foreignId()`, `$table->constrained()`, `$table->unique()`, `$table->index()`, `$table->timestamps()`, `$table->softDeletes()`, etc.).
3.  **Determine Migration Order:** Create migrations in an order that respects foreign key constraints. Tables must exist before they can be referenced by a foreign key.
    *   Order: `users`, `plans`, `episodes`, `protocols` -> `subscriptions`, `episode_protocol`, `summaries`, `notes` -> `user_protocol_tracking` (if implemented). Standard Laravel tables (`password_resets`, `jobs`, `failed_jobs`) can usually be created anytime or might already exist.
4.  **Generate Migration Files:** Use the `php artisan make:migration create_table_name_table` command for each table.
5.  **Implement `up()` Method:** Populate the `up()` method in each migration file with the `Schema::create(...)` logic derived in step 2.
6.  **Implement `down()` Method:** Populate the `down()` method with the corresponding `Schema::dropIfExists('table_name')` to ensure migrations can be rolled back cleanly.
7.  **Refine Constraints and Indexes:** Double-check:
    *   **Data Types:** Use appropriate types (`string`, `text`, `integer`, `bigInteger`, `boolean`, `date`, `timestamp`, `jsonb` for Postgres).
    *   **Nullability:** Apply `->nullable()` where needed.
    *   **Uniqueness:** Use `->unique()`.
    *   **Defaults:** Use `->default(...)`.
    *   **Foreign Keys:** Use `->foreignId('column')->constrained('related_table')->onDelete('action')`. Choose `cascade`, `restrict`, `set null`, or `no action` carefully based on relationships (e.g., `cascade` for user-owned data like notes/subscriptions, `restrict` for plans linked to active subscriptions).
    *   **Indexes:** Add `->index()` for frequently queried columns (FKs often indexed automatically by `constrained()`, status fields, categories, dates). Use array syntax for composite indexes (`->index(['col1', 'col2'])`).
    *   **Timestamps/Soft Deletes:** Use `$table->timestamps()` and `$table->softDeletes()` where appropriate.
8.  **Testing:** Run `php artisan migrate` on a local development database to verify syntax and execution. Test rollbacks using `php artisan migrate:rollback`.
9.  **Version Control:** Commit the generated migration files to the Git repository.

**3. Migration File Structure (Conceptual)**

Below is the conceptual structure for each required migration file. Specific commands to generate them are included.

**(Note:** Assumes a fresh Laravel project structure. Some standard migrations like `users`, `password_resets`, `failed_jobs` might pre-exist and need modification instead of creation.)

**10. Standard Laravel Tables (If needed)**

*   **Password Resets:** `php artisan make:migration create_password_resets_table` (Check if exists first)
*   **Jobs:** `php artisan queue:table` then `php artisan migrate`
*   **Failed Jobs:** `php artisan make:migration create_failed_jobs_table` (Check if exists first)

---

**4. Execution**

After creating and reviewing these files:

1.  Ensure your `.env` file is configured with the correct database connection details.
2.  Run `php artisan migrate` from your project root in the terminal.
3.  Laravel will execute the `up()` method of each pending migration in chronological order.

**5. Outcome**

The result will be a database schema matching the application's requirements, managed entirely through version-controlled Laravel migration files. This allows for consistent setup across development, staging, and production environments, and provides a clear history of schema changes.

**Huberman App (Optimize Guide): Implementation Preparation Plan**

**1. Transition Summary**

We have successfully completed the high-level application description and architectural blueprint phases for the Huberman App. The architecture outlines a Modular Monolith (Laravel/PHP backend), a React Native frontend, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching/queuing, and a RESTful API, all designed to support the defined Freemium subscription model. This document details the next crucial phase: transitioning from the architectural vision to actionable technical specifications, project setup, and environment preparation necessary to initiate development efficiently and effectively. The objective is to establish a solid foundation for the implementation lifecycle.

**2. Detailed Technical Design & Specifications**

This phase focuses on refining the high-level architecture into granular component designs and technical specifications.

*   **Component Breakdown (Modular Monolith):**
    *   **Process:** Decompose the Laravel backend into logical, domain-driven modules (Namespaces/Folders). Based on the architecture and features, initial modules will likely include: `Authentication`, `UserManagement`, `SubscriptionBilling` (integrating with chosen payment provider/Cashier), `ContentManagement` (Episodes, Protocols, Summaries), `ProtocolEngine` (Reminder logic, Tracking), `NotesService`, `CommunityFeatures` (if applicable early), and `CoreApi`.
    *   **Outcome:** Clearly defined code boundaries and responsibilities within the Laravel application structure.
*   **Component Interfaces & Interactions:**
    *   **Process:** Define the specific internal contracts (Service Classes, Interfaces, Events) for how these backend modules interact. Document the flow of data and control, especially for cross-cutting concerns like subscription status checks. For frontend-backend interaction, focus on the API.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented internal interaction patterns (e.g., Sequence Diagrams for key flows) and clear responsibilities for each module.
*   **API Design & Documentation:**
    *   **Process:** Formalize the RESTful API contract. Utilize OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to define all endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication methods (Laravel Sanctum/Passport), and authorization requirements. Explicitly tag endpoints requiring 'Premium' subscription status. Key areas include: Auth (login, register, password reset), User Profile, Plans/Subscriptions (fetching offers, potentially linking to provider portals), Content (fetching episodes, protocols, summaries - with filtering for free/premium), Notes (CRUD, public/private flags), Reminders (CRUD for premium), Tracking (logging adherence for premium). Define error handling standards (HTTP status codes, error response structure). Define webhook endpoints for payment providers (Stripe/Paddle, Apple App Store Server Notifications, Google Play Developer API).
    *   **Outcome:** A version-controlled `openapi.yaml` or `swagger.json` file serving as the definitive API contract for both frontend and backend teams.
*   **Database Schema Refinement:**
    *   **Process:** Review the provided `database_plan.md` SQL schema. Convert it into Laravel Migrations. Finalize data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE), foreign key relationships (with appropriate ON DELETE behavior - e.g., CASCADE for notes on user delete, RESTRICT for plans on active subscriptions). Define necessary indexes based on anticipated query patterns (e.g., indexing `subscriptions.user_id`, `subscriptions.status`, `subscriptions.ends_at`, `notes.user_id`, `notes.episode_id`, `protocols.category`). Plan for potential future schema evolution using migrations.
    *   **Outcome:** A complete set of executable Laravel migration files checked into version control, representing the definitive database structure.
*   **Complex Workflow/Algorithm Design:**
    *   **Process:** Document the specific logic for complex features identified in the architecture:
        *   **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Detail the state machine for subscriptions (`trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `expired`) and how webhook events from Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google trigger state transitions and update the `subscriptions` table.
        *   **Feature Gating Logic:** Specify the implementation details for Laravel Middleware/Policies that check the user's active subscription status (querying `subscriptions` table, potentially using cached flags from Redis) before granting access to premium API routes or features.
        *   **Customizable Reminders (Premium):** Design the scheduling mechanism (likely using Laravel's Task Scheduling + Queues) to trigger push notifications based on user-defined times/frequencies for specific protocols.
        *   **Tracking & Visualization Logic (Premium):** Define how adherence data is stored and how it will be aggregated for progress visualizations (e.g., streak calculation).
    *   **Outcome:** Sequence diagrams, state diagrams, or pseudo-code documenting the core logic for these critical flows.
*   **Technology Version & Library Finalization:**
    *   **Process:** Lock down specific versions: PHP (e.g., 8.2+), Laravel (e.g., 10.x/11.x), PostgreSQL (e.g., 17), Redis (e.g., 7.x), Node.js (LTS for React Native tooling), React Native (latest stable). Select and document key libraries: `laravel/cashier-stripe` or `laravel/cashier-paddle`, `react-native-iap`, Push Notification library (e.g., `react-native-push-notification` or cloud provider SDKs), state management for RN (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
    *   **Outcome:** Updated `composer.json`, `package.json`, and potentially a project README or Architecture Decision Record (ADR) listing finalized versions and libraries.

**3. Project Planning & Development Readiness**

Translate the technical design into a manageable project plan and prepare the team.

*   **Requirements Refinement (User Stories):**
    *   **Process:** Break down the features from `app_description.md` (both Free and Premium tiers) into granular User Stories (e.g., "As a Free User, I want to see summaries for foundational protocols so that I can understand the basics," "As a Premium User, I want to set a custom daily reminder for 'Morning Sunlight Viewing' so that I don't forget," "As a Premium User, I want to mark a protocol as completed for the day so that I can track my adherence"). Use a tool like Jira or Trello. Prioritize stories for an MVP, focusing on core free functionality and the subscription mechanism first, followed by premium features.
    *   **Outcome:** A populated backlog of estimated User Stories in the chosen project management tool.
*   **Detailed Estimation:**
    *   **Process:** Estimate the effort for each User Story based on the detailed technical designs (e.g., using Story Points or time estimates). This should be done collaboratively by the development team.
    *   **Outcome:** Estimated backlog providing a basis for timeline creation.
*   **Granular Project Timeline & Milestones:**
    *   **Process:** Develop a sprint-based or Kanban-based timeline. Define key milestones:
        *   M1: Project Setup Complete (Repo, CI/CD Base, Local Env).
        *   M2: Core Backend Ready (Auth, User Mgmt, DB Migrations, Basic API Shell).
        *   M3: Basic Content Display (Free Tier Protocols/Summaries visible in RN App).
        *   M4: Subscription Flow PoC (IAP Integration, Backend Webhooks, Basic Feature Gate).
        *   M5: Free Tier Feature Complete (Basic Reminders, Notes).
        *   M6: Premium Feature Set 1 (e.g., Full Content Access, Custom Reminders).
        *   M7: Premium Feature Set 2 (e.g., Tracking, Offline Access).
        *   M8: Beta Release / Production Readiness.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented project plan with sprints/phases, milestones, and dependencies visualized.
*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   **Process:** Assign development team members (Backend Devs, Frontend RN Devs, QA, potentially DevOps support) to specific modules, epics, or sprints based on skills and availability.
    *   **Outcome:** Clear ownership of tasks/modules within the team.
*   **Essential Tooling Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Configure and grant access to necessary tools:
        *   Project Management: Jira/Trello board setup.
        *   Version Control: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository creation, branch strategy definition (e.g., Gitflow).
        *   Communication: Slack/Teams channel setup.
        *   Documentation: Confluence/Notion space creation for technical docs, ADRs, meeting notes.
    *   **Outcome:** Operational project infrastructure ready for team use.
*   **Development Environment Configuration:**
    *   **Process:** Finalize and distribute the Docker configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) as specified in the architecture. Ensure it includes containers for PHP-FPM, Nginx/Caddy, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Node.js (for frontend tooling). Provide clear instructions for setup and usage. Standardize environment variable management (e.g., `.env` files with templates).
    *   **Outcome:** Developers can quickly and consistently set up identical local development environments.

**4. UI/UX Design Integration (If Applicable)**

If not already completed, this is a critical parallel activity, especially for the React Native frontend.

*   **Process:** Ensure finalized, high-fidelity mockups and prototypes are available and signed off. These must cover:
    *   All key user flows (onboarding, browsing content, setting reminders, taking notes, tracking progress).
    *   Clear visual differentiation between Free and Premium features/content.
    *   User-friendly prompts and flows for upgrading to Premium.
    *   Platform-specific design conventions (iOS/Android).
    *   Creation of a component library/design system for consistency.
*   **Outcome:** Signed-off UI/UX designs and a style guide/component library ready for frontend development.

**5. Infrastructure & Environment Setup**

Prepare the cloud/hosting environments required beyond local development.

*   **Infrastructure Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the Laravel Forge/Vapor choice, plan the specific server sizes/configurations (if using Forge) or review Vapor's serverless scaling model. Estimate initial database (PostgreSQL) and cache (Redis) resource needs (using managed services). Plan for object storage (S3/GCS) for potential offline content or user uploads.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented infrastructure requirements and initial sizing estimates.
*   **Cloud Service Selection:**
    *   **Process:** Confirm choices: Forge/Vapor for hosting, AWS RDS/Managed Postgres provider, AWS ElastiCache/Managed Redis provider, S3/GCS for storage. Set up accounts if necessary.
    *   **Outcome:** Finalized list of cloud services and providers.
*   **Environment Provisioning:**
    *   **Process:** Use Forge/Vapor (or Terraform/Pulumi if more control is desired) to provision the initial Dev, Staging, and Production environments. This includes setting up servers/services, databases, caches, and configuring network access/security groups.
    *   **Outcome:** Functional cloud environments ready for deployment.
*   **Monitoring, Logging, Alerting Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Sentry, CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana) into the provisioned environments. Configure basic logging aggregation (e.g., Vapor logs, CloudWatch Logs, ELK stack). Set up initial alerts for critical events (e.g., high error rates, server down, high DB connections). Integrate Laravel Telescope for Dev/Staging.
    *   **Outcome:** Foundational observability infrastructure in place.
*   **Backup & Recovery Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Configure automated database backups (e.g., using RDS snapshots or provider tools) with defined retention policies. Document the recovery procedure (e.g., restoring from a snapshot).
    *   **Outcome:** Initial backup strategy implemented and documented.

**6. Security Deep Dive & Planning**

Integrate security rigorously from the start.

*   **Detailed Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Process:** Conduct a threat modeling session (e.g., using STRIDE) based on the detailed technical design, data flows, and features (especially authentication, subscription handling, user notes, potential community features). Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented threat model identifying key risks and potential attack vectors.
*   **Define Specific Technical Security Controls:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the threat model and architecture, define concrete security controls:
        *   **Authentication:** Specify token expiry, refresh token strategy, password complexity rules, brute-force protection (rate limiting).
        *   **Authorization:** Detail the implementation of Laravel Policies/Middleware for checking `subscriptions.status` for premium features. Ensure no business logic relies solely on client-side checks.
        *   **Encryption:** Enforce TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS), confirm database encryption at rest, define secure storage for API keys/secrets (e.g., environment variables injected via Forge/Vapor, potentially a secrets manager).
        *   **Input Validation:** Define strategy (e.g., Laravel Form Requests) for validating all incoming API request data.
        *   **Payment Security:** Reiterate server-side validation of IAP receipts and secure webhook handling (signature verification).
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Plan for tools like `composer audit`, `npm audit`.
    *   **Outcome:** A checklist or document detailing specific security controls to be implemented and verified.
*   **Security Testing Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Plan for integrating security testing into the development lifecycle:
        *   **SAST:** Configure static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, ESLint security plugins) to run locally and/or in CI.
        *   **DAST:** Plan for using basic dynamic analysis tools against the Staging environment later in the cycle.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Allocate budget/time for external penetration testing before major production launches.
    *   **Outcome:** Security testing activities integrated into the project plan and CI/CD strategy.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Foundation**

Automate the build, test, and deployment process early.

*   **Process:** Set up the initial CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or Jenkins) connected to the version control repository. Configure initial stages:
    *   Trigger on push/merge to `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   Checkout code.
    *   Install dependencies (`composer install`, `npm install`).
    *   Run linters and static analysis (SAST tools).
    *   Run automated tests (Unit, Integration - e.g., `php artisan test`, `npm test`).
    *   Build frontend assets (`npm run build`).
    *   (Initial) Deploy script targeting the Dev/Staging environment using Forge CLI/API or Vapor CLI deployment commands.
*   **Outcome:** A basic, functional CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment to lower environments, ready to be expanded as the project progresses.

**8. Initiation of Development**

With the detailed plans and setup complete, development can commence.

*   **Process:** The development team begins implementation based on the prioritized backlog (User Stories), detailed technical designs, API specifications, and established environment/tooling setup.
*   **Initial Focus:**
    *   Setting up the base Laravel and React Native project structures.
    *   Implementing core database migrations (Users, Plans, Subscriptions, initial Content tables).
    *   Building the Authentication flow (backend API and frontend screens).
    *   Establishing basic API communication between frontend and backend.
    *   Setting up the basic subscription scaffolding (e.g., integrating Laravel Cashier, defining Plan models).
*   **Outcome:** Development kickoff, focusing on foundational components and demonstrating core connectivity.

*   **Integration:**
    *   `[ ]` Connect Auth screens to API service functions and state management.
    *   `[ ]` Handle loading states and display errors from API responses.
    *   `[ ]` Implement navigation logic: navigate to Main App stack on successful login/register, navigate to Auth stack on logout or initial load if not authenticated.
    *   `[ ]` (Test) Write component tests for Auth screens, mocking navigation and API calls.

---

## Phase 3: Main App Shell & Basic Content Display (Free Tier)

    *   `[ ]` Add subscription status (`plan`, `status`, `ends_at`) to relevant store (`authStore` or dedicated `billingStore`).
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to periodically fetch/refresh subscription status from `/user/subscription` API.
*   **Integration:**
    *   `[ ]` Use `react-native-iap` functions to:
        *   `[ ]` Fetch product details (`getProducts`).
        *   `[ ]` Initiate purchase flow (`requestSubscription`).
    *   `[ ]` Handle IAP purchase results (success, failure, cancellation).
        *   *Note:* The primary validation happens backend via webhooks. Frontend may need to inform the backend "purchase initiated" or simply refresh user/subscription status after a short delay or upon app foregrounding to reflect changes validated by the backend. Discuss exact flow with backend team.
    *   `[ ]` Display current subscription status on Settings screen.
    *   `[ ]` Conditionally display "Upgrade" prompts or premium features based on subscription status from the state store.
    *   `[ ]` Handle IAP initialization errors and loading states.
    *   `(Test)` Write tests for store logic related to subscription status.

---

## Phase 5: Premium Features (MVP Scope)

*   **Content Display:**
    *   `[ ]` Enhance Protocol Detail screen to display *full summaries/details* if user state indicates premium (`authStore.user.is_premium` or `billingStore.isActive`). Fetch potentially richer data from `/protocols/{id}` API (API needs to return it for premium users).
*   **Custom Reminders:**
    *   `[ ]` (UI) Build Reminder List screen (Premium only).
    *   `[ ]` (UI) Build Create/Edit Reminder screen (Premium only).
    *   `[ ]` Implement API service functions (`src/services/api/reminders.ts`) for CRUD:
        *   `[ ]` `GET /reminders` (API)
        *   `[ ]` `POST /reminders` (API)
        *   `[ ]` `PUT /reminders/{id}` (API)
        *   `[ ]` `DELETE /reminders/{id}` (API)
    *   `[ ]` Fetch and display existing reminders.
    *   `[ ]` Implement form for creating/editing reminders (selecting protocol, time).
    *   `[ ]` Integrate screens with API calls, handling loading/error states.
    *   `[ ]` Ensure Reminder screens/features are only accessible/visible to premium users.

---

## Phase 6: Push Notifications Setup

*   **Firebase Setup:**
    *   `[ ]` Install `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging`.
    *   `[ ]` Configure Firebase project (iOS/Android apps). Download and add config files (`GoogleService-Info.plist`, `google-services.json`).
    *   `[ ]` Implement native setup for Firebase messaging (AppDelegate, Podfile, build.gradle changes).
*   **Token Handling:**
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to request user permission for notifications.
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to get the FCM device token using `@react-native-firebase/messaging`.
    *   `[ ]` Implement API service function (`src/services/api/user.ts`) to send the token to the backend (`POST /api/user/device-token`) (API).
    *   `[ ]` Send token to backend upon successful login or when the token refreshes.
*   **Notification Handling:**
    *   `[ ]` Implement listeners for foreground notifications.
    *   `[ ]` Implement listeners/setup for background/quit state notification handling.
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to display incoming reminder notifications (or let OS handle basic display).

---

## Phase 7: Refinement, Testing & QA

*   **Styling & Polish:**
    *   `[ ]` (UI) Perform visual review across all screens against Figma designs. Adjust styles for consistency and pixel-perfection (within reason).
    *   `[ ]` Ensure consistent loading indicators and empty states.
    *   `[ ]` Ensure responsive layout handling on different screen sizes/orientations.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   `[ ]` Implement user-friendly display for API errors (e.g., toast messages, inline errors).
    *   `[ ]` Handle network connectivity issues gracefully.
*   **Testing:**
    *   `[ ]` (Test) Write/improve unit tests for utility functions, hooks, store logic.
    *   `[ ]` (Test) Write/improve component tests using `@testing-library/react-native`.
    *   `[ ]` Perform manual end-to-end testing of all user flows (Free & Premium).
*   **Accessibility (A11y):**
    *   `[ ]` Add appropriate `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityRole` props.
    *   `[ ]` Check color contrast ratios.
    *   `[ ]` Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack).
*   **Performance:**
    *   `[ ]` Profile app performance if necessary (React Native Perf Monitor, Flipper). Optimize slow components or heavy computations.

---

## Phase 8: Build & Deployment Preparation

*   **Configuration:**
    *   `[ ]` Configure app icons and splash screens.
    *   `[ ]` Configure build settings (version codes, bundle IDs, signing certificates) for iOS and Android release builds.
    *   `[ ]` Ensure environment variable configuration works correctly for different builds (staging, production pointing to correct API URLs).
*   **App Store Setup:**
    *   `[ ]` Create app listings in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.
    *   `[ ]` Prepare required metadata (descriptions, screenshots, privacy policy URL).
*   **Build & Test:**
    *   `[ ]` Generate release builds for iOS (`.ipa`) and Android (`.aab`).
    *   `[ ]` Test release builds thoroughly on physical devices.

---

## Phase 9: Launch & Post-Launch

*   **Release:**
    *   `[ ]` Submit builds to TestFlight (iOS) / Internal Testing (Android) for final QA.
    *   `[ ]` Submit builds for App Store / Google Play review.
    *   `[ ]` Coordinate release timing with backend team.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   `[ ]` Integrate and configure crash reporting service (Sentry, Bugsnag).
    *   `[ ]` Monitor crash reports and user feedback post-launch.
    *   `[ ]` Address critical issues promptly via patches/updates.

**Huberman App: Infrastructure & DevOps Specifics**

**1. Introduction**

This document provides more specific details and initial configurations for the infrastructure and DevOps components outlined in the project plan and backend TODO list. It includes a concrete example for `docker-compose.yml`, a basic CI/CD pipeline structure using GitHub Actions, and initial recommendations for monitoring, logging, and backup configurations. These are starting points and should be refined based on specific hosting choices (Forge/Vapor) and evolving project needs.

**2. Local Development Environment (`docker-compose.yml`)**

This configuration provides the necessary services for local backend development and testing. Place this file in the project root.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # PHP Service (Application Server)
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile # Assumes a Dockerfile exists for PHP setup
      args:
        UID: "${UID:-1000}" # Pass host user ID for permissions
        GID: "${GID:-1000}" # Pass host group ID for permissions
    container_name: huberman_app_php
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
    environment:
      SERVICE_NAME: app
      SERVICE_TAGS: dev
      # Pass environment variables from .env file
      PHP_IDE_CONFIG: "serverName=Docker" # Example for Xdebug integration
      XDEBUG_MODE: "${XDEBUG_MODE:-off}" # Control Xdebug mode via .env
      XDEBUG_CONFIG: "client_host=host.docker.internal" # Xdebug config for Docker Desktop
    working_dir: /var/www/html
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html # Mount application code
      # Persist bash history (optional)
      # - ./docker-data/bashhistory:/root/.bash_history_docker
    networks:
      - huberman_app_network
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  # Web Server (Nginx)
  webserver:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: huberman_app_nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
    ports:
      - "${APP_PORT:-8000}:80" # Expose app port from .env or default 8000
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
      - ./docker/nginx/conf.d/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/ # Mount custom Nginx config
    networks:

    depends_on:
      - app

  # Database Server (PostgreSQL)
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: huberman_app_db
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
    ports:
      - "${DB_PORT:-5432}:5432" # Expose DB port from .env or default 5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: "${DB_DATABASE:-huberman_db}"
      POSTGRES_USER: "${DB_USERNAME:-sail}" # Use Sail defaults or .env values
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${DB_PASSWORD:-password}"
      POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: "trust" # For easy local connections, change if needed
    volumes:
      - huberman_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persistent DB data
      # Optional: Mount init scripts
      # - ./docker/db/init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    networks:
      - huberman_app_network
    healthcheck: # Basic healthcheck
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "${DB_USERNAME:-sail}", "-d", "${DB_DATABASE:-huberman_db}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  # Cache Server (Redis)
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: huberman_app_redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${REDIS_PORT:-6379}:6379" # Expose Redis port from .env or default 6379
    volumes:

    networks:
      - huberman_app_network
    healthcheck: # Basic healthcheck
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

# Define Networks
networks:
  huberman_app_network:
    driver: bridge

# Define Volumes
volumes:
  huberman_db_data:
    driver: local
  huberman_redis_data:
    driver: local

```

**Notes on `docker-compose.yml`:**

*   **`Dockerfile`:** This setup assumes a `Dockerfile` in the root for the `app` service to handle PHP setup, installing extensions (like `pdo_pgsql`, `pgsql`, `redis`, `bcmath`, `pcntl`, `gd`), composer installation, and potentially setting user permissions correctly. You'll need to create this file.
*   **`.env` Integration:** It relies heavily on your project's `.env` file for configuration (ports, DB credentials, etc.). Ensure your `.env` file is present and correctly configured. Use `.env.example` as a template.
*   **UID/GID:** Passing host user/group IDs helps avoid permission issues with mounted volumes, especially file creation by PHP.
*   **Nginx Config:** Requires a custom Nginx configuration file (e.g., `docker/nginx/conf.d/app.conf`) to proxy requests to the `app` service (PHP-FPM on port 9000).
*   **Xdebug:** Includes basic Xdebug configuration for easier debugging. Control via `XDEBUG_MODE` in `.env`.
*   **Healthchecks:** Basic checks added to ensure services are responsive.

**3. CI/CD Pipeline Definition (GitHub Actions Example)**

This provides a basic pipeline structure for running tests and static analysis on pushes/PRs to `main` and `develop`. Place this in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Laravel CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services: # Start dependent services for testing
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: huberman_test_db
          POSTGRES_USER: sail
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
          POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust # Easiest for CI connection
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
      redis:
        image: redis:7-alpine
        ports:
          - 6379:6379
        options: >-
          --health-cmd "redis-cli ping"
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

        php artisan key:generate

    - name: Wait for Services (Postgres)
      run: |
        echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL to start..."
        until pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U sail; do
          sleep 1

    # Optional: NPM Steps if needed for backend assets
    # - name: Install NPM Dependencies
    #   run: npm ci
    # - name: Build Assets
    #   run: npm run build
```

**Notes on `ci.yml`:**

*   **Services:** Uses GitHub Actions `services` to run PostgreSQL and Redis alongside the main job container, making them accessible on `127.0.0.1`.
*   **Environment:** Copies `.env.example` and modifies it specifically for the CI environment database/redis services.
*   **Dependencies:** Caches Composer dependencies for faster runs.
*   **Tests:** Runs Pint, PHPStan, and PHPUnit. Add other checks as needed.
*   **Deployment:** Deployment steps (Forge, Vapor, etc.) are *not* included here but would typically be added as separate jobs triggered manually or on merges to `main`.

**4. Monitoring, Logging & Backup Specifics (Initial Recommendations)**

These are starting points, adjust based on provider capabilities (Forge/Vapor often provide defaults) and application sensitivity.

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Key Metrics:**
        *   System: CPU (<80%), Memory (<85%), Disk Space (<90% full).
        *   Application: 5xx Error Rate (<1%), Average API Response Time (<500ms), Requests Per Minute.
        *   Queue: `jobs` table count (< 100 pending for > 5 mins), `failed_jobs` count (> 0).
    *   **Tools:** Leverage Forge/Vapor built-in monitoring. Consider Sentry (or Flare for Laravel) for error tracking & basic performance monitoring. For more depth, look at Datadog or New Relic later.

*   **Logging:**
    *   **Level:** Production: `WARNING` or `ERROR`. Staging/Dev: `DEBUG`.
    *   **Channel (Laravel `config/logging.php`):**
        *   Use the `stack` channel.
        *   Include `daily` file logging (`path/to/storage/logs/laravel.log`).
        *   Integrate a log aggregation service (if using Forge/Vapor check their recommendations, otherwise Papertrail, Logtail, Datadog Logs). Configure a `syslog` or dedicated driver pointing to the service.
    *   **Format:** Configure the `stack` channel or aggregation channel to use a `Monolog\Formatter\JsonFormatter` for structured logging.
    *   **Key Events to Log (Contextual):** User registration/login failures, password resets, subscription webhook received (start/end/status), subscription state changes, job processing start/end/failure, critical errors caught in exception handler, manual logging for complex workflow steps. **AVOID LOGGING SENSITIVE DATA.**

*   **Alerting (Initial Critical Alerts):**
    *   Configure via monitoring tool (Forge/Vapor/Datadog/Sentry):
        *   5xx Error Rate > 2% over 5 minutes.
        *   Server/Instance Unreachable.
        *   CPU or Memory > 90% for 5 minutes.
        *   Disk Space > 95% full.
        *   Failed Jobs Count increases significantly or > X total.
        *   Queue length grows consistently without processing.
        *   Sentry/Flare reports a spike in new or existing errors.

*   **Backups (Database - PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Mechanism:** **Strongly recommend** using the managed database provider's automated snapshot feature (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, DigitalOcean Managed DB).
    *   **Frequency:** Daily automated snapshots.
    *   **Retention:** Start with **7 days**. Evaluate if longer retention (e.g., 14-30 days) is needed based on recovery requirements.
    *   **Verification:** **Schedule and perform quarterly test restores** of a recent backup to a temporary database instance to confirm integrity and practice the recovery procedure. Document the process.
    *   **Location:** Ensure backups are stored geographically separate (usually handled by cloud providers).

**5. Conclusion**

These concrete configurations provide a solid starting point for the Huberman App's infrastructure and DevOps practices. They establish a consistent local development environment, automate basic testing and validation via CI, and outline initial strategies for observing and protecting the application in deployed environments. Remember to version control `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and adapt these configurations as the project evolves and specific hosting choices are finalized.

**Huberman App: Security Plan**

**1. Introduction**

Security is a critical aspect of the Huberman App, especially considering user data, authentication, and subscription payments. This document outlines the plan for integrating security practices throughout the development lifecycle, including threat modeling, defining specific technical controls, and planning for security testing. The goal is to build a secure and trustworthy application by proactively identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

**2. Detailed Threat Modeling**

*   **Process:**
    *   A dedicated threat modeling session will be conducted early in the implementation phase, involving backend developers, potentially frontend developers, and project leads.
    *   The **STRIDE methodology** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) will be used as a framework.
    *   The analysis will focus on key data flows and components based on the detailed technical design (`component_interfaces_interactions.md`, `complex_workflows.md`) and API contract (`api_design_documentation.md`), specifically targeting:
        *   Authentication flow (Registration, Login, Password Reset, Token Handling)
        *   Subscription lifecycle management (IAP, Webhooks, Status Updates)
        *   Feature Gating logic (Free vs. Premium access)
        *   User-generated content (Notes - storage, access control, potential public sharing)
        *   API endpoints (Input validation, Authorization checks)
        *   Data storage (Database, Cache)
        *   Third-party integrations (Payment providers, Push notification services)
    *   For each component/flow, potential threats based on STRIDE categories will be identified, documented, and ranked based on potential impact and likelihood.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   A documented Threat Model (e.g., in a separate document linked here, or appended).
    *   This model will list identified threats, potential attack vectors, existing planned mitigations (from this document), and any additional required security controls or areas needing further investigation.
    *   This document will serve as a living reference, revisited if major architectural changes occur.

**3. Specific Technical Security Controls**

Based on the architecture, known best practices, and anticipated threats, the following technical security controls will be implemented and verified:

**3.1. Authentication & Session Management**

*   **Mechanism:** Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication.
*   **Token Strategy:**
    *   Issue API tokens upon successful login/registration.
    *   Tokens will have a configured expiration time (e.g., configurable, potentially hours or days for mobile usability, balancing security and UX). *Decision: Initially target [e.g., 7 days] expiry, review based on UX/security needs.*
    *   Refresh tokens are *not* part of Sanctum's default API token flow; re-authentication will be required after token expiry. Consider Sanctum's SPA authentication if persistent sessions are strongly desired and feasible with React Native setup, but API tokens are simpler initially.
*   **Password Policy:** Enforce minimum password complexity (e.g., length, character types) during registration and password reset using Laravel validation rules.
*   **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (`/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) using Laravel's built-in rate limiter or dedicated packages.
*   **Secure Storage:** Passwords stored securely using Laravel's default hashing mechanism (Bcrypt).

**3.2. Authorization**

*   **Backend Enforcement:** All authorization decisions MUST be made on the backend (Laravel). No reliance on client-side (React Native) checks for controlling access to data or features.
*   **Subscription Checks:** Use dedicated Middleware (e.g., `CheckPremiumAccess`) applied to API routes/groups requiring premium status. This middleware will leverage the `SubscriptionServiceInterface` to check for an active, valid premium subscription (status `active` or `trialing`, within `ends_at` date).
*   **Ownership & Policies:** Use Laravel Policies (e.g., `NotePolicy`, `ReminderPolicy`) to ensure users can only access and modify their own resources (preventing Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR). Policies check `user_id` matches the authenticated user.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure API endpoints only return data necessary for the specific function.

**3.3. Encryption**

*   **In Transit:** Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) for all communication between the React Native app and the Laravel API. Configure web server (via Forge/Vapor) for HTTPS only, potentially with HSTS headers.
*   **At Rest:** Leverage database encryption-at-rest features provided by the managed PostgreSQL provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL). Confirm this is enabled during infrastructure setup.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   API keys, database credentials, payment provider secrets, and other sensitive configuration MUST NOT be hardcoded in the repository.
    *   Use environment variables (`.env` file locally, secure environment variable injection via Forge/Vapor in deployed environments).
    *   Consider using a dedicated secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault) for production keys if complexity warrants it later.

**3.4. Input Validation & Sanitization**

*   **Validation:** Use Laravel Form Requests for validating all incoming data from API requests (query parameters, request bodies). Define strict validation rules for data types, formats, lengths, presence, etc.
*   **Output Encoding:** Use Blade's default encoding (`{{ }}`) if rendering any user content in web views (less likely for API). For API responses, ensure proper JSON encoding handles special characters. Avoid rendering user-provided content directly as HTML in the frontend without appropriate sanitization/encoding (React Native generally handles this well).
*   **Sanitization:** While strict validation is key, sanitize input specifically intended for database queries where complex filtering might occur, although Eloquent/Query Builder typically provides protection against SQL injection.

**3.5. Payment Security**

*   **IAP Receipt Validation:** All Apple App Store and Google Play In-App Purchase receipts MUST be validated server-side by sending them from the Laravel backend to the respective provider's validation endpoints. Do not trust client-side validation results.
*   **Webhook Security:** Securely handle incoming webhooks from payment providers (Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google) by:
    *   Verifying the request signature using the provider's secret key (configured via environment variables). Reject any requests with invalid signatures.
    *   Processing events idempotently where possible (e.g., check if the subscription status is already updated before applying the change again).

**3.6. Dependency Management**

*   **Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies:
    *   Backend: Run `composer audit` locally and/or in the CI pipeline.
    *   Frontend: Run `npm audit` locally and/or in the CI pipeline.
*   **Updates:** Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date, prioritizing security patches. Use tools like GitHub Dependabot to automate update pull requests.

**3.7. General Security**

*   **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, potentially `Content-Security-Policy` if serving any web content) via web server or middleware.
*   **Error Handling:** Configure Laravel error reporting to avoid exposing sensitive information (stack traces, database details) in production API responses. Return generic error messages for 5xx errors.
*   **Logging:** Implement sufficient logging to track key security events (e.g., login attempts, password resets, subscription changes, significant errors), but avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or full payment details. Centralize logs for monitoring.

**4. Security Testing Planning**

Security testing will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle:

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    *   **Tools:** Configure static analysis tools like PHPStan/Psalm with security-focused extensions (e.g., `psalm/plugin-security-analysis`) for the backend. Use ESLint with security plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`) for React Native frontend code.
    *   **Integration:** Run SAST tools locally via Git hooks (optional) and mandatorily within the CI/CD pipeline on every commit/pull request to catch potential issues early.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
    *   **Timing:** Periodically run DAST scans against the deployed application in the Staging environment.
    *   **Tools:** Initially, consider using OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for basic automated scanning of common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi - though less likely with framework defaults, still worth checking). Explore more advanced tools or services if budget allows later.
*   **Manual Code Review:** Encourage security-focused code reviews as part of the standard pull request process, especially for critical areas like authentication, authorization, and payment handling.
*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Timing:** Schedule external penetration testing by a reputable third-party vendor before the first major production launch and potentially before subsequent major feature releases or annually.
    *   **Scope:** Define the scope to cover key application functionality, including authentication, subscription flows, premium feature access, notes handling, API endpoints, and infrastructure configuration.
    *   **Budget:** Allocate budget and time for engaging penetration testing services and remediating identified findings.

**5. Incident Response (Basic Considerations)**

*   While a full incident response plan is beyond this scope, basic readiness includes:
    *   Having access to centralized logs.
    *   Defining communication channels for reporting and handling security incidents.
    *   Understanding how to quickly revoke compromised credentials or disable features if necessary.

**6. Conclusion**

This security plan provides a framework for building security into the Huberman App from the ground up. By implementing the defined technical controls, performing regular testing, and fostering a security-aware development culture, we aim to significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and protect user data and trust. This plan should be treated as a living document and updated as the application evolves.

**Huberman App: Holistic Testing Strategy**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Huberman App project, encompassing both the backend (Laravel) and frontend (React Native) components. The primary goal is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, secure, and user-friendly application that meets all functional and non-functional requirements. This strategy adopts a multi-layered approach, integrating various testing types throughout the development lifecycle.

**2. Testing Objectives**

*   **Verify Requirements:** Ensure the application functions according to the defined user stories and acceptance criteria (`user_stories_mvp.md`).
*   **Prevent Regressions:** Detect defects introduced by new code changes or refactoring early in the cycle.
*   **Build Confidence:** Provide confidence to the team, stakeholders, and users in the application's stability and correctness before release.
*   **Early Defect Detection:** Identify and fix bugs as early as possible in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of remediation.
*   **Ensure Quality Attributes:** Validate non-functional requirements, including performance, security, and usability.

**3. Testing Levels & Scope**

We will employ a balanced mix of automated and manual testing across different levels:

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests**
    *   **Scope:** Focus on testing the smallest isolated parts of the codebase (individual functions, methods, classes, components, hooks, utils). Dependencies are typically mocked or stubbed.
    *   **Backend (Laravel):** Test model logic, service class methods, form request validation rules, utility functions. Follows TDD principles outlined in `backend_implementation_todo.md`.
    *   **Frontend (React Native):** Test individual UI components' rendering and basic interactions, utility functions, state management logic (store actions/reducers/selectors), custom hooks.
    *   **Goal:** Verify the correctness of individual code units, fast feedback for developers.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers during development, automatically in the CI pipeline on every commit/PR.

*   **Level 2: Integration Tests (Backend)**
    *   **Scope:** Verify the interaction and communication between multiple backend modules or components (e.g., Controller -> Service -> Repository/Model, Event -> Listener). May involve interaction with a test database and cache.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure different parts of the backend work together as expected.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers, automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 3: Component Tests (Frontend)**
    *   **Scope:** Test React Native components with more complex interactions, including state changes, prop handling, and basic rendering within a simulated environment, but without full navigation or backend APIs.
    *   **Goal:** Verify component behavior and integration with state management or child components.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers, automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 4: API / Contract Tests (Backend)**
    *   **Scope:** Test the backend API endpoints directly, verifying adherence to the defined contract (`openapi.yaml`). Check request validation, authentication/authorization logic, response structure, status codes, and basic business logic execution.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the API behaves as expected from an external consumer's perspective (the frontend) and prevent breaking changes.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers (Laravel Feature Tests), automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 5: End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
    *   **Scope:** Simulate real user scenarios by interacting with the complete, deployed application (React Native app interacting with the backend API in a dedicated test/staging environment).
    *   **Goal:** Validate complete user flows from start to finish across the entire stack.
    *   **Execution:** Run primarily in Staging environment. Due to complexity, initial focus might be on automating critical paths (e.g., login, core free feature, subscription purchase, core premium feature access). May run nightly or on-demand rather than every commit. Can be supplemented heavily by manual testing initially.

*   **Level 6: Manual Exploratory & Acceptance Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Human-driven testing involving unscripted exploration of the application to uncover usability issues, edge cases, and unexpected behavior. Also includes scripted testing based on user story acceptance criteria.
    *   **Goal:** Catch issues missed by automated tests, validate the user experience, confirm requirements are met from a user perspective. Includes Design QA (comparing implementation to Figma designs).
    *   **Execution:** Performed primarily on Staging builds by QA, Product Owners, and Designers.

*   **Level 7: Security Testing**
    *   **Scope:** As defined in `security_plan.md`. Includes SAST, DAST, and planned external Penetration Testing.
    *   **Goal:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Execution:** SAST in CI pipeline. DAST periodically on Staging. Penetration testing before major releases.

*   **Level 8: Performance Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Assess backend API response times under simulated load, frontend app startup time, screen transition performance, memory usage.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application meets performance expectations and scales appropriately.
    *   **Execution:** Primarily post-MVP or before major releases on a Staging environment resembling production. Initial checks via developer tools during development.

*   **Level 9: Usability Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Observing representative users interacting with the application to perform specific tasks.
    *   **Goal:** Identify usability friction points and gather qualitative feedback on the user experience.
    *   **Execution:** Planned sessions coordinated by UX designers/researchers, likely conducted periodically during development and before major launches.

**4. Tools & Technologies**

*   **Backend Unit/Integration/API:** PHPUnit
*   **Frontend Unit/Component:** Jest, React Native Testing Library (RNTL)

**6. Testing Environments**

*   **Local:** Developers run Unit, Integration, Component, API tests during coding.
*   **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automated execution of Unit, Integration, Component, API tests, and SAST checks upon code commits/PRs. Build failures block merges.
*   **Staging:** Deployed environment closely resembling production. Used for Manual QA, Acceptance Testing, E2E automation runs, DAST scans, Performance testing.
*   **Production:** Live environment. Testing is limited to essential post-deployment smoke tests and ongoing monitoring.

**7. Integration with Development Process**

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated tests (Levels 1-4) are mandatory gates in the CI pipeline. A failing build prevents code merging. E2E tests may run separately (e.g., nightly).
*   **Definition of Done (DoD):** A user story or task is considered "Done" only when:
    *   Code is implemented according to requirements.
    *   Relevant unit, integration, component, and API tests are written and passing.
    *   Code passes CI checks (including SAST).
    *   Code is peer-reviewed.
    *   Functionality is successfully tested by QA (manual/automated E2E) in Staging.
    *   Design QA is completed (if applicable).

Okay, let's translate the high-level vision for the "Huberman App" (Optimize Guide) into a detailed technical plan and setup outline for the implementation phase.

---

**Huberman App (Optimize Guide): Implementation Preparation Plan**

**1. Transition Summary**

We have successfully completed the high-level application description and architectural blueprint phases for the Huberman App. The architecture outlines a Modular Monolith (Laravel/PHP backend), a React Native frontend, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching/queuing, and a RESTful API, all designed to support the defined Freemium subscription model. This document details the next crucial phase: transitioning from the architectural vision to actionable technical specifications, project setup, and environment preparation necessary to initiate development efficiently and effectively. The objective is to establish a solid foundation for the implementation lifecycle.

**2. Detailed Technical Design & Specifications**

This phase focuses on refining the high-level architecture into granular component designs and technical specifications.

*   **Component Breakdown (Modular Monolith):**
    *   **Process:** Decompose the Laravel backend into logical, domain-driven modules (Namespaces/Folders). Based on the architecture and features, initial modules will likely include: `Authentication`, `UserManagement`, `SubscriptionBilling` (integrating with chosen payment provider/Cashier), `ContentManagement` (Episodes, Protocols, Summaries), `ProtocolEngine` (Reminder logic, Tracking), `NotesService`, `CommunityFeatures` (if applicable early), and `CoreApi`.
    *   **Outcome:** Clearly defined code boundaries and responsibilities within the Laravel application structure.
*   **Component Interfaces & Interactions:**
    *   **Process:** Define the specific internal contracts (Service Classes, Interfaces, Events) for how these backend modules interact. Document the flow of data and control, especially for cross-cutting concerns like subscription status checks. For frontend-backend interaction, focus on the API.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented internal interaction patterns (e.g., Sequence Diagrams for key flows) and clear responsibilities for each module.
*   **API Design & Documentation:**
    *   **Process:** Formalize the RESTful API contract. Utilize OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to define all endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication methods (Laravel Sanctum/Passport), and authorization requirements. Explicitly tag endpoints requiring 'Premium' subscription status. Key areas include: Auth (login, register, password reset), User Profile, Plans/Subscriptions (fetching offers, potentially linking to provider portals), Content (fetching episodes, protocols, summaries - with filtering for free/premium), Notes (CRUD, public/private flags), Reminders (CRUD for premium), Tracking (logging adherence for premium). Define error handling standards (HTTP status codes, error response structure). Define webhook endpoints for payment providers (Stripe/Paddle, Apple App Store Server Notifications, Google Play Developer API).
    *   **Outcome:** A version-controlled `openapi.yaml` or `swagger.json` file serving as the definitive API contract for both frontend and backend teams.
*   **Database Schema Refinement:**
    *   **Process:** Review the provided `database_plan.md` SQL schema. Convert it into Laravel Migrations. Finalize data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE), foreign key relationships (with appropriate ON DELETE behavior - e.g., CASCADE for notes on user delete, RESTRICT for plans on active subscriptions). Define necessary indexes based on anticipated query patterns (e.g., indexing `subscriptions.user_id`, `subscriptions.status`, `subscriptions.ends_at`, `notes.user_id`, `notes.episode_id`, `protocols.category`). Plan for potential future schema evolution using migrations.
    *   **Outcome:** A complete set of executable Laravel migration files checked into version control, representing the definitive database structure.
*   **Complex Workflow/Algorithm Design:**
    *   **Process:** Document the specific logic for complex features identified in the architecture:
        *   **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Detail the state machine for subscriptions (`trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `expired`) and how webhook events from Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google trigger state transitions and update the `subscriptions` table.
        *   **Feature Gating Logic:** Specify the implementation details for Laravel Middleware/Policies that check the user's active subscription status (querying `subscriptions` table, potentially using cached flags from Redis) before granting access to premium API routes or features.
        *   **Customizable Reminders (Premium):** Design the scheduling mechanism (likely using Laravel's Task Scheduling + Queues) to trigger push notifications based on user-defined times/frequencies for specific protocols.
        *   **Tracking & Visualization Logic (Premium):** Define how adherence data is stored and how it will be aggregated for progress visualizations (e.g., streak calculation).
    *   **Outcome:** Sequence diagrams, state diagrams, or pseudo-code documenting the core logic for these critical flows.
*   **Technology Version & Library Finalization:**
    *   **Process:** Lock down specific versions: PHP (e.g., 8.2+), Laravel (e.g., 10.x/11.x), PostgreSQL (e.g., 17), Redis (e.g., 7.x), Node.js (LTS for React Native tooling), React Native (latest stable). Select and document key libraries: `laravel/cashier-stripe` or `laravel/cashier-paddle`, `react-native-iap`, Push Notification library (e.g., `react-native-push-notification` or cloud provider SDKs), state management for RN (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
    *   **Outcome:** Updated `composer.json`, `package.json`, and potentially a project README or Architecture Decision Record (ADR) listing finalized versions and libraries.

**3. Project Planning & Development Readiness**

Translate the technical design into a manageable project plan and prepare the team.

*   **Requirements Refinement (User Stories):**
    *   **Process:** Break down the features from `app_description.md` (both Free and Premium tiers) into granular User Stories (e.g., "As a Free User, I want to see summaries for foundational protocols so that I can understand the basics," "As a Premium User, I want to set a custom daily reminder for 'Morning Sunlight Viewing' so that I don't forget," "As a Premium User, I want to mark a protocol as completed for the day so that I can track my adherence"). Use a tool like Jira or Trello. Prioritize stories for an MVP, focusing on core free functionality and the subscription mechanism first, followed by premium features.
    *   **Outcome:** A populated backlog of estimated User Stories in the chosen project management tool.
*   **Detailed Estimation:**
    *   **Process:** Estimate the effort for each User Story based on the detailed technical designs (e.g., using Story Points or time estimates). This should be done collaboratively by the development team.
    *   **Outcome:** Estimated backlog providing a basis for timeline creation.
*   **Granular Project Timeline & Milestones:**
    *   **Process:** Develop a sprint-based or Kanban-based timeline. Define key milestones:
        *   M1: Project Setup Complete (Repo, CI/CD Base, Local Env).
        *   M2: Core Backend Ready (Auth, User Mgmt, DB Migrations, Basic API Shell).
        *   M3: Basic Content Display (Free Tier Protocols/Summaries visible in RN App).
        *   M4: Subscription Flow PoC (IAP Integration, Backend Webhooks, Basic Feature Gate).
        *   M5: Free Tier Feature Complete (Basic Reminders, Notes).
        *   M6: Premium Feature Set 1 (e.g., Full Content Access, Custom Reminders).
        *   M7: Premium Feature Set 2 (e.g., Tracking, Offline Access).
        *   M8: Beta Release / Production Readiness.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented project plan with sprints/phases, milestones, and dependencies visualized.
*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   **Process:** Assign development team members (Backend Devs, Frontend RN Devs, QA, potentially DevOps support) to specific modules, epics, or sprints based on skills and availability.
    *   **Outcome:** Clear ownership of tasks/modules within the team.
*   **Essential Tooling Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Configure and grant access to necessary tools:
        *   Project Management: Jira/Trello board setup.
        *   Version Control: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository creation, branch strategy definition (e.g., Gitflow).
        *   Communication: Slack/Teams channel setup.
        *   Documentation: Confluence/Notion space creation for technical docs, ADRs, meeting notes.
    *   **Outcome:** Operational project infrastructure ready for team use.
*   **Development Environment Configuration:**
    *   **Process:** Finalize and distribute the Docker configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) as specified in the architecture. Ensure it includes containers for PHP-FPM, Nginx/Caddy, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Node.js (for frontend tooling). Provide clear instructions for setup and usage. Standardize environment variable management (e.g., `.env` files with templates).
    *   **Outcome:** Developers can quickly and consistently set up identical local development environments.

**4. UI/UX Design Integration (If Applicable)**

If not already completed, this is a critical parallel activity, especially for the React Native frontend.

*   **Process:** Ensure finalized, high-fidelity mockups and prototypes are available and signed off. These must cover:
    *   All key user flows (onboarding, browsing content, setting reminders, taking notes, tracking progress).
    *   Clear visual differentiation between Free and Premium features/content.
    *   User-friendly prompts and flows for upgrading to Premium.
    *   Platform-specific design conventions (iOS/Android).
    *   Creation of a component library/design system for consistency.
*   **Outcome:** Signed-off UI/UX designs and a style guide/component library ready for frontend development.

**5. Infrastructure & Environment Setup**

Prepare the cloud/hosting environments required beyond local development.

*   **Infrastructure Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the Laravel Forge/Vapor choice, plan the specific server sizes/configurations (if using Forge) or review Vapor's serverless scaling model. Estimate initial database (PostgreSQL) and cache (Redis) resource needs (using managed services). Plan for object storage (S3/GCS) for potential offline content or user uploads.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented infrastructure requirements and initial sizing estimates.
*   **Cloud Service Selection:**
    *   **Process:** Confirm choices: Forge/Vapor for hosting, AWS RDS/Managed Postgres provider, AWS ElastiCache/Managed Redis provider, S3/GCS for storage. Set up accounts if necessary.
    *   **Outcome:** Finalized list of cloud services and providers.
*   **Environment Provisioning:**
    *   **Process:** Use Forge/Vapor (or Terraform/Pulumi if more control is desired) to provision the initial Dev, Staging, and Production environments. This includes setting up servers/services, databases, caches, and configuring network access/security groups.
    *   **Outcome:** Functional cloud environments ready for deployment.
*   **Monitoring, Logging, Alerting Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Sentry, CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana) into the provisioned environments. Configure basic logging aggregation (e.g., Vapor logs, CloudWatch Logs, ELK stack). Set up initial alerts for critical events (e.g., high error rates, server down, high DB connections). Integrate Laravel Telescope for Dev/Staging.
    *   **Outcome:** Foundational observability infrastructure in place.
*   **Backup & Recovery Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Configure automated database backups (e.g., using RDS snapshots or provider tools) with defined retention policies. Document the recovery procedure (e.g., restoring from a snapshot).
    *   **Outcome:** Initial backup strategy implemented and documented.

**6. Security Deep Dive & Planning**

Integrate security rigorously from the start.

*   **Detailed Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Process:** Conduct a threat modeling session (e.g., using STRIDE) based on the detailed technical design, data flows, and features (especially authentication, subscription handling, user notes, potential community features). Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented threat model identifying key risks and potential attack vectors.
*   **Define Specific Technical Security Controls:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the threat model and architecture, define concrete security controls:
        *   **Authentication:** Specify token expiry, refresh token strategy, password complexity rules, brute-force protection (rate limiting).
        *   **Authorization:** Detail the implementation of Laravel Policies/Middleware for checking `subscriptions.status` for premium features. Ensure no business logic relies solely on client-side checks.
        *   **Encryption:** Enforce TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS), confirm database encryption at rest, define secure storage for API keys/secrets (e.g., environment variables injected via Forge/Vapor, potentially a secrets manager).
        *   **Input Validation:** Define strategy (e.g., Laravel Form Requests) for validating all incoming API request data.
        *   **Payment Security:** Reiterate server-side validation of IAP receipts and secure webhook handling (signature verification).
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Plan for tools like `composer audit`, `npm audit`.
    *   **Outcome:** A checklist or document detailing specific security controls to be implemented and verified.
*   **Security Testing Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Plan for integrating security testing into the development lifecycle:
        *   **SAST:** Configure static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, ESLint security plugins) to run locally and/or in CI.
        *   **DAST:** Plan for using basic dynamic analysis tools against the Staging environment later in the cycle.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Allocate budget/time for external penetration testing before major production launches.
    *   **Outcome:** Security testing activities integrated into the project plan and CI/CD strategy.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Foundation**

Automate the build, test, and deployment process early.

*   **Process:** Set up the initial CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or Jenkins) connected to the version control repository. Configure initial stages:
    *   Trigger on push/merge to `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   Checkout code.
    *   Install dependencies (`composer install`, `npm install`).
    *   Run linters and static analysis (SAST tools).
    *   Run automated tests (Unit, Integration - e.g., `php artisan test`, `npm test`).
    *   Build frontend assets (`npm run build`).
    *   (Initial) Deploy script targeting the Dev/Staging environment using Forge CLI/API or Vapor CLI deployment commands.
*   **Outcome:** A basic, functional CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment to lower environments, ready to be expanded as the project progresses.

**8. Initiation of Development**

With the detailed plans and setup complete, development can commence.

*   **Process:** The development team begins implementation based on the prioritized backlog (User Stories), detailed technical designs, API specifications, and established environment/tooling setup.
*   **Initial Focus:**
    *   Setting up the base Laravel and React Native project structures.
    *   Implementing core database migrations (Users, Plans, Subscriptions, initial Content tables).
    *   Building the Authentication flow (backend API and frontend screens).
    *   Establishing basic API communication between frontend and backend.
    *   Setting up the basic subscription scaffolding (e.g., integrating Laravel Cashier, defining Plan models).
*   **Outcome:** Development kickoff, focusing on foundational components and demonstrating core connectivity.

**Huberman App: UI/UX Design Handoff & Integration Plan**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the standardized process for handing off finalized User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) designs from the design team to the frontend (React Native) development team for the Huberman App. The goal is to ensure a smooth, efficient, and accurate translation of the design vision into a functional application, maintaining fidelity with the intended **Microsoft Fluent UI** aesthetic.

**2. Guiding Principles**

*   **Collaboration:** Open communication between design and development is essential throughout the process.
*   **Clarity:** Handoff materials must be clear, unambiguous, and provide all necessary details for implementation.
*   **Consistency:** Designs should adhere to a consistent design system and component library approach.
*   **Efficiency:** Utilize standard tools and processes to minimize friction and rework.

**3. Target Aesthetic: Microsoft Fluent UI**

The application aims for a look and feel inspired by Microsoft's Fluent Design System. This influences the handoff in several ways:

*   **Design References:** Designers should utilize official Fluent Design System documentation (web guidelines, potentially WinUI/MAUI examples for principles) as a primary reference, adapting concepts appropriately for a mobile React Native context.
*   **Component Library Strategy (Key Decision Needed):**
    *   **Option A (Recommended if mature):** Leverage an existing Fluent UI library for React Native (e.g., `fluentui-react-native` provided by Microsoft). Designers should align their components with those available in the chosen library where possible. The handoff must clearly indicate which standard library components are used and specify any required customizations (theming, styling overrides).
    *   **Option B (Custom Build):** If a suitable library isn't available or doesn't meet needs, developers will build custom components based strictly on Fluent guidelines and the provided Figma specifications. This requires more development effort and very precise specifications from the designer.
    *   **Decision:** The specific library (or decision to build custom) needs to be finalized collaboratively between design and frontend development leads early on. This document assumes a library *might* be used, requiring designers to reference it.
*   **Figma Toolkit:** Designers are encouraged to use a Fluent UI Design Kit for Figma (if available and suitable) to maintain consistency and speed up the design process.

**4. Key Tools**

*   **Design & Prototyping:** **Figma** will be the primary tool for creating designs, prototypes, specifications, and exporting assets.
*   **Component Documentation (Developer Built):** **Storybook** will be used by frontend developers to build and document the reusable React Native components interactively, based on Figma specs. Designers will reference Storybook during Design QA.
*   **Communication:** **Slack/Teams** (specify channel) for asynchronous communication and quick questions. Regular sync meetings as needed.
*   **Project Management:** **Jira/Trello** (specify board/project) for tracking UI implementation user stories/tasks derived from the designs.

**5. Handoff Process**

1.  **Design Finalization & Review:**
    *   Designer completes user flows, screen designs, and component definitions in Figma for a specific feature or set of features.
    *   Internal design review is conducted.
    *   Designs are reviewed with Product Management/Stakeholders for functional sign-off.

2.  **Preparation in Figma:**
    *   **Organization:** Figma file is well-organized with clear page structures (e.g., by flow, by feature) and layer naming conventions.
    *   **Components:** Reusable elements (buttons, inputs, cards, list items, navigation bars etc.) are created as Figma Components with variants defined (e.g., states like disabled, different sizes) aligned with Fluent principles and the chosen library strategy (see Sec 3).
    *   **Styles:** Colors, typography (font families - specify font files if custom, sizes, weights), spacing values, and grids/layouts are defined as Figma Styles.
    *   **Specs:** Auto-layout and constraints are used effectively to ensure responsive behavior and clear spacing/padding intent. Measurements, colors, and typography details should be easily inspectable using Figma's built-in "Inspect" panel.
    *   **Assets:** All icons, illustrations, or images needed are prepared as exportable assets within Figma (preferably SVG for icons, PNG @1x, @2x, @3x resolutions for raster images). Naming conventions for assets should be established.
    *   **Prototyping:** Key user flows are linked using Figma's prototyping features to demonstrate navigation and interactions.

3.  **Handoff Meeting:**
    *   The Designer schedules a walkthrough session with the assigned Frontend Developer(s) and relevant QA/PM roles.
    *   **Agenda:**
        *   Present the overall user flow(s).
        *   Walk through key screens, highlighting interactions, transitions, and edge cases.
        *   Review reusable components and their variants/states.
        *   Point out specific Fluent UI patterns or library components being used/customized.
        *   Explain the structure of the Figma file (Styles, Components, Assets).
        *   Answer developer questions.

4.  **Providing Access:**
    *   Frontend developers are given "View" or "Edit" (if needed for inspection plugins) access to the finalized Figma file/page.

5.  **Implementation & Clarification:**
    *   Frontend developers translate the Figma designs and specifications into React Native code, utilizing the agreed-upon component library strategy.
    *   Developers use the Figma Inspect panel to get exact values for styles and spacing.
    *   Developers export required assets directly from Figma.
    *   Developers use the designated communication channel (Slack/Teams) to ask clarifying questions as they arise during implementation. Designers should be responsive.

6.  **Design QA:**
    *   Once a feature/component is implemented (preferably on a device or simulator build shared via a Staging/Dev environment), the Designer performs a Design QA review.
    *   Compare the implementation against the Figma designs for visual fidelity, pixel perfection (within reason), interaction accuracy, and adherence to Fluent UI principles.
    *   Provide feedback via the project management tool (Jira/Trello comments/bugs) or a dedicated feedback tool, referencing specific screens/components.

**6. Key Deliverables from Design**

*   **Link to the finalized Figma file**, properly organized and prepared as described above.
*   Clear specification of **required font files** if using custom fonts not available by default.
*   Defined **asset export settings** and naming conventions.
*   Documentation (within Figma or linked) clarifying the **component library strategy** (use of `fluentui-react-native` vs. custom build) and specific customizations needed.

**7. Frontend Developer Responsibilities**

*   Attend the handoff meeting and ask clarifying questions.
*   Use the Figma file and Inspect panel as the source of truth for UI specifications.
*   Implement components and screens adhering to the provided specs and Fluent UI guidelines.
*   Build/update the Storybook documentation for reusable components.
*   Export assets correctly.
*   Communicate proactively if ambiguities or technical limitations arise.
*   Facilitate Design QA by providing access to implemented builds.
*   Address Design QA feedback.

**8. Conclusion**

This handoff process, centered around Figma and clear communication, aims to streamline the integration of finalized Fluent UI-inspired designs into the Huberman App's React Native frontend. By following these steps, we can ensure consistency, accuracy, and efficient collaboration between the design and development teams.

# Script Name: create_snapshot.sh
# Description: Scans a Git repository, extracts content from text files and
#              paths of image/other files, ignores specified directories/files,
#              and consolidates the information into a single snapshot file
#              in the project root, prepended with an AI context instruction.
#              Finally, attempts to reveal the snapshot file in the default
#              file manager (opens folder, selects file where possible).
# Usage:       Place this script anywhere. Run it from within a Git repository
#              or any subdirectory. It will automatically find the root.
#              ./create_snapshot.sh
